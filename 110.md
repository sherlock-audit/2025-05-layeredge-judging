# Potential High Gas Consumption in Tier Adjustment Logic During Stake/Unstake

### Summary

The `_stake()` and `_unstake()` functions can incur significantly high gas costs when the number of stakers in the `stakerTree` is large. This is due to the `_checkBoundariesAndRecord()` function, which is called on every stake/unstake that modifies `stakerCountInTree`. This function, in turn, calls `_findAndRecordTierChange()` multiple times. Each call to `_findAndRecordTierChange()` performs operations with `O(log N)` complexity on the Fenwick tree (multiple SLOADs) and can also trigger SSTORE operations if a user's tier changes. For a large number of stakers, these accumulated gas costs can make `stake()` and `unstake()` transactions prohibitively expensive, potentially exceeding the block gas limit.

### Root Cause

The `_checkBoundariesAndRecord()`([line 846](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L846)) function, called during `_stake()`([approx. line 673](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L673)) and `_unstake()`([line 720](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L720)) operations that alter `stakerCountInTree`, iterates to update user tiers. Specifically, it calls `_findAndRecordTierChange()`([line 897](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L897)) multiple times (typically 2-4 times). Each call to `_findAndRecordTierChange()` involves:
1.  Two Fenwick tree operations (`findByCumulativeFrequency` and `query` from `FenwickTree.sol`), each with `O(log N)` complexity involving multiple SLOADs.
2.  Potential SSTORE operations within `_recordTierChange` if a user's tier is updated.
The accumulation of these gas-intensive operations (SLOADs and SSTOREs) across multiple calls, especially with a large number of stakers (`N = stakerCountInTree`), leads to high gas consumption.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.  `stakerCountInTree` needs to be significantly large (e.g., tens of thousands or more) for the `log N` factor in Fenwick tree operations to contribute to substantial gas costs.
2.  A `stake()` operation occurs that results in a new staker being added to the `stakerTree` (i.e., `amount >= minStakeAmount` and the user was not previously in the tree or was `outOfTree`).
    OR
    An `unstake()` operation occurs where a user's balance falls below `minStakeAmount`, causing them to be removed from the `stakerTree`.
3.  These operations trigger `_checkBoundariesAndRecord()`, which then determines that users at tier boundaries need their tiers re-evaluated and potentially changed, leading to calls to `_findAndRecordTierChange()`.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A for this specific gas issue, as it's primarily dependent on internal contract state and logic.

### Attack Path

This is less of an "attack" path and more of a "vulnerability" or performance issue path:
1.  The number of active stakers in the `stakerTree` grows to a very large number over time.
2.  A user attempts to `stake()` (and enters the tree) or `unstake()` (and leaves the tree).
3.  The transaction calls `_checkBoundariesAndRecord()`.
4.  This function makes several calls to `_findAndRecordTierChange()`.
5.  Each `_findAndRecordTierChange()` call executes `O(log N)` Fenwick tree operations (many SLOADs) and potentially SSTOREs via `_recordTierChange()`.
6.  The sum of gas for these operations, repeated 2-4 times, plus the baseline cost of stake/unstake, becomes excessively high.
7.  **Result:** The transaction either costs the user a very large amount of gas or, in extreme cases, fails due to exceeding the block gas limit.

**Gas Cost Accumulation Example (from original report):**
If `_stakerCountInTree` (N_stk) = 65,536 (2^16), then `log N_stk = 16`.
- Gas for Fenwick operations per `_findAndRecordTierChange` call: `(16 SLOADs + 16 SLOADs) * 2100 gas/SLOAD = 67,200` gas.
- Gas for SSTOREs in `_recordTierChange` (if tier changes): `~20,000` to `~40,000` gas.
- Total per `_findAndRecordTierChange` call: Roughly `87,200` to `107,200` gas.
If `_checkBoundariesAndRecord` makes 2 to 4 such calls, the additional gas cost for tier adjustments alone could range from `~174,400` to `~428,800` gas.

### Impact

- **High Gas Costs:** `stake()` and `unstake()` operations become increasingly expensive as the number of stakers grows, potentially discouraging participation or making small stakes/unstakes economically unviable.
- **Potential Denial of Service (DoS):** In extreme cases with a very large number of stakers, the gas required for these operations might exceed the block gas limit. This would effectively prevent users from performing actions that change `stakerCountInTree` (i.e., entering or leaving the tree), impacting core contract functionality.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Several approaches could be considered to mitigate this issue:

1.  **Gas Cost Analysis and Documentation:** Perform a thorough gas cost analysis for `stake()` and `unstake()` operations across a range of `stakerCountInTree` values. Clearly document the expected gas costs for users.
2.  **Optimize `_findAndRecordTierChange`:**
    *   While the Fenwick tree operations are standard `O(log N)`, ensure the implementation is as efficient as possible.
    *   Minimize SSTOREs in `_recordTierChange`. For example, if `stakerTierHistory` is only for informational purposes and not critical for core logic, consider if its updates can be made more gas-efficient or if its length should be bounded.
3.  **Decouple Tier Adjustments (More Complex):**
    *   Consider if immediate tier adjustments for all boundary-crossing users are strictly necessary within the `stake`/`unstake` transaction.
    *   One advanced approach could be to flag users whose tiers *might* need an update, and have a separate, potentially privileged function that can be called periodically (or by users themselves for their own tier) to process these updates in batches or individually. This would shift the gas burden but add complexity.
4.  **Set Realistic System Capacity:** If optimizations are insufficient, acknowledge a practical limit on `stakerCountInTree` beyond which gas costs become prohibitive, and design system parameters or incentives accordingly.
5.  **Alternative Data Structure:** For very large N, explore if alternative data structures to Fenwick trees could offer better gas performance for the specific query patterns used, though Fenwick trees are generally efficient for prefix sums and point updates.
