# Precision loss from calculating interest adds up over time

### Summary

Precision loss from calculating interest adds up over time

### Root Cause

When calculating and updating users' accrued interest, we have this calculation:

```solidity
        uint256 fromTime = user.lastClaimTime;
        uint256 toTime = block.timestamp;

        ...

        // Process tier periods starting from the relevant tier
        uint256 periodStart = fromTime;
        uint256 periodEnd;

        // First handle the tier the user was in at fromTime
        if (
            relevantStartIndex + 1 < userTierHistory.length
                && userTierHistory[relevantStartIndex + 1].timestamp < toTime
        ) {
            periodEnd = userTierHistory[relevantStartIndex + 1].timestamp;
        } else {
            periodEnd = toTime;
        }

        // Calculate interest for this initial period
        if (periodEnd > periodStart) {
            uint256 apy = getTierAPYForPeriod(currentTier, periodStart, periodEnd);
            uint256 periodInterest =
>>              ((user.balance * apy * (periodEnd - periodStart)) / (SECONDS_IN_YEAR * PRECISION)) / 100;
            totalInterest += periodInterest;
        }
```

No math library is used and we have a calculation with 2 divisions taking place. APY's and periods can be changed so we can have different variables in the system and it's not constant. Also worth noting that the `periodStart` time is the `user.lastClaimTime` so with each stake/unstake/interaction with the contract by the user, the value used in the multiplication can be larger/smaller.

All in all, the precision loss due to rounding down will be fractional but it will happen twice due to the double division. Since the interest updating function gets called on pretty much every single user interaction with the protocol, overtime this will add up and lead to yield losses over 0.01% for all users which will also depend on how often they interact with the contract and warrants medium severity. It's a systematic yield loss affecting all users, with more active users being penalized more heavily.

This is amplified by the fact that during interest calculation we have 2 of these applied:

```solidity
    function calculateUnclaimedInterest(address userAddr) public view returns (uint256 totalInterest) {
        ...

        // Calculate interest for this initial period
        if (periodEnd > periodStart) {
            uint256 apy = getTierAPYForPeriod(currentTier, periodStart, periodEnd);
            uint256 periodInterest =
>>              ((user.balance * apy * (periodEnd - periodStart)) / (SECONDS_IN_YEAR * PRECISION)) / 100;
            totalInterest += periodInterest;
        }

        // Then process any subsequent tier changes within our calculation window
        for (uint256 i = relevantStartIndex + 1; i < userTierHistory.length; i++) {
            if (userTierHistory[i].timestamp >= toTime) break;

            periodStart = userTierHistory[i].timestamp;
            periodEnd = (i == userTierHistory.length - 1) ? toTime : userTierHistory[i + 1].timestamp;
            if (periodEnd > toTime) periodEnd = toTime;

            if (periodEnd <= periodStart) continue;

            Tier periodTier = userTierHistory[i].to;
            uint256 apy = getTierAPYForPeriod(periodTier, periodStart, periodEnd);

            uint256 periodInterest =
>>              ((user.balance * apy * (periodEnd - periodStart)) / (SECONDS_IN_YEAR * PRECISION)) / 100;
            totalInterest += periodInterest;
        }
        return totalInterest;
    }
```

Example:

Balance: 10e18
APY: 20%
Period: 1 hour (3600seconds) due to frequent interactions
SECONDS_IN_YEAR: 31536000
PRECISION: 1e18

step1 = (10e18 * 2000 * 3600) / (31536000 * 1e18) 
      = 72000000000000000000000 / 31536000000000000000000000
      = 2 (truncated from 2.283...)

step2 = 2 / 100 = 0 yield (instead of 22 wei)

Even with just 46 interactions, 22 * 46 = 1,012 wei lost, which is >0.01% of 10e18 balance.

Although the stake amount is low, users are absolutely allowed to stake small amounts and reap the yield of the smallest APY of 20%.

This will add up to higher losses when it happens to all users and not just one, and the likelihood of the issue is not really considered according to Sherlock's rules either. The loss covers the 0.01% yield loss rule.

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Yield losses from rounding down due to precision loss will add up overtime to more than 0.01% of users' yield which warrants medium severity.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Higher precision during reward accrual can be used to minimize losses. SafeMath library is an option as well.
