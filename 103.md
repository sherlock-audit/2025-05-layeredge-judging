# calling `setMinStakeAmount` would always make the tiering system inconsistent

### Summary

if owner decided to change the minimum stake amount by calling `setMinStakeAmount` then the tier system would completely inconsistent because of how the minimum stake amount is checked.

### Root Cause

first we need to understand how the rank is not dependend of the amount staked and the rank would always holds into FCFS (first come first serve).
the twist is if any user amount is staked lower than the minimum stake amount then they are permanently got into rank 3 and out of the tier system completely.

the amount staked is only checked in first `stake` call, and every `unstake` calls.

[_stake](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L691-L713):
```solidity
        //Staking for first time and amount is less than minStakeAmount, user will be in tier 3 permanently and out of the tree
        if (!user.isActive && amount < minStakeAmount) {
...
        }

        // If first time staking, register staker position whose stake is more than minStakeAmount
        if (!user.isActive && amount >= minStakeAmount) {
...
        }
```

[_unstake]()
```solidity
        if (!user.outOfTree && user.balance < minStakeAmount) {
...
        }
```

if the owner decided to change the minimum stake amount (whether if its increased or decreased), it would not affecting the current staker and only affect the new staker or old staker who is calling `unstake`.

thus it is possible to make the tiering system inconsistent, if the case when the minimum stake amount is increased. where the old staker that now have `user.balance < minStakeAmount` are still inside their current tier (lets assume they are tier 1 with highest apy).

the problem is: this user only affected by the new stake amount when they calling `unstake`. so they can choose to not do anything and still having the highest apy when in fact he should not eligible for it because of the new stake amount.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. admin deploy the contract
2. set tier apy to default
3. set the minimum stake to default value (3000e18)

### External Pre-conditions

1. user1 stake 3000e18


### Attack Path

1. admin calls `setMinStakeAmount` with 3500e18
2. user1 still eligible with the current apy tier 1 because their balance are not checked unless they `unstake`

### Impact

I want to clarify that this is not admin malicious action.
admin create the function so he can change the minimum stake.

now if admin call the function `setMinStakeAmount` and provide changes to the current minimum amount, there are NO mechanism for current user so they REQUIRED to top up their balance to keep their tier APY and not kicked into tier 3 out of tree system.

thus making the tiering system inconsistent about the minimum stake, as there are exist staker whose balance is now under the minimum stake but still benefited from the non tier 3 apy.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

if the minimum stake amount is changed, protocol needs to prompt the old staker so they can choose to top up their balances (either via new added stake or via compoundInterest function) to keep their tier apy or not.
this mechanism can be done when user try to claiming the reward. can also implement it on stake/unstake.
