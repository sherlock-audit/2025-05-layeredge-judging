# Reentrancy Vulnerability in emergencyWithdraw Function in LayerEdgeStaking.sol

### Summary

The `emergencyWithdraw` function in `LayerEdgeStaking.sol` is vulnerable to reentrancy because it transfers Ether to the caller via `call` before updating the user’s staked balance or other state variables. This allows an attacker to recursively call `emergencyWithdraw`, potentially draining the contract’s funds.



### Root Cause

In `LayerEdgeStaking.sol:137` the `emergencyWithdraw` function uses `call` to transfer Ether to the caller (`msg.sender`) before updating the state (e.g., resetting `stakedBalance[msg.sender]`). This violates the checks-effects-interactions pattern, enabling reentrancy attacks.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The `LayerEdgeStaking.sol` contract is deployed with funds (Ether or tokens) available for withdrawal.
2. A user has a non-zero `stakedBalance` recorded in the contract.
3. The `emergencyWithdraw` function is callable (e.g., not restricted by additional modifiers beyond `onlyOwner` or paused state, depending on implementation).

### External Pre-conditions

1. An attacker deploys a malicious contract with a `fallback` or `receive` function that recursively calls `emergencyWithdraw` upon receiving Ether.
2. The attacker’s address has a non-zero `stakedBalance` in `LayerEdgeStaking.sol`.

### Attack Path

1. An attacker deploys a malicious contract with a receive function that calls `LayerEdgeStaking.emergencyWithdraw`.
2. The attacker calls `emergencyWithdraw` from their malicious contract, triggering the Ether transfer in `LayerEdgeStaking.sol:137`.
3. Before `stakedBalance[msg.sender]` is updated (e.g., set to 0), the Ether transfer invokes the attacker’s `receive` function.
4. The `receive` function re-calls `emergencyWithdraw`, repeating the process and withdrawing the same `stakedBalance` multiple times until the contract is drained or gas limits are reached.

### Impact

- An attacker can drain the contract’s funds (Ether or tokens) by repeatedly withdrawing their `stakedBalance` before it is reset, leading to significant loss of funds for the protocol or other users.  
- In a staking contract, this could result in the loss of all staked assets, undermining the protocol’s integrity and user trust.  
- The vulnerability is exploitable under realistic conditions (e.g., a malicious contract with a crafted `receive` function), meeting Sherlock’s high-severity criteria for direct financial loss.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface ILayerEdgeStaking {
    function emergencyWithdraw() external;
}

contract ReentrancyAttack {
    ILayerEdgeStaking public stakingContract;
    uint256 public attackCount;

    constructor(address _stakingContract) {
        stakingContract = ILayerEdgeStaking(_stakingContract);
    }

    receive() external payable {
        if (attackCount < 5) { // Limit reentrancy for testing
            attackCount++;
            stakingContract.emergencyWithdraw();
        }
    }

    function attack() external {
        attackCount = 0;
        stakingContract.emergencyWithdraw();
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Apply the checks-effects-interactions pattern by updating state (e.g., stakedBalance[msg.sender]) before making external calls.
Alternatively, use OpenZeppelin’s ReentrancyGuard to prevent reentrancy.
Example implementation with `ReentrancyGuard`:

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/Pausable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract LayerEdgeStaking is Pausable, Ownable, ReentrancyGuard {
    mapping(address => uint256) public stakedBalance;

    // Existing code...

    /// @notice Allows users to withdraw their staked balance in an emergency
    /// @dev Protected against reentrancy
    function emergencyWithdraw() external nonReentrant {
        uint256 amount = stakedBalance[msg.sender];
        require(amount > 0, "No balance to withdraw");
        stakedBalance[msg.sender] = 0; // Update state first
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
    }
}
