###Title: 
LayerEdgeStaking::stake does not cap stake input, which can break rank logic or overflow math.

Description

The stake() function allows users to deposit any amount above minStakeAmount, but there’s no upper limit. This opens up a risk where someone passes a very large number to manipulate their tier unfairly or break internal math. A malicious user could stake a huge value to gain top rank, push others down, or even trigger an overflow in totalStaked.

Here’s the function:
```solidity
function stake(uint256 amount) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant updateTierOnChange(msg.sender) {
    require(amount >= minStakeAmount, "Below minimum stake");

    Stake storage stakeData = userStakes[msg.sender];
    stakeData.amount += amount;
    stakeData.tier = getUserTier(msg.sender);

    totalStaked += amount;

    fenwickTree.insert(msg.sender, stakeData.amount);

    require(stakingToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount), "Token transfer failed");

    emit Staked(msg.sender, amount);
}
```
Impact

A user can pass in type(uint256).max

This can overflow totalStaked or their stake amount

Fenwick Tree gets corrupted, tier boundaries become meaningless

APY and FCFS logic break for everyone else


Proof of Concept

1. Malicious user calls stake(2**256 - 1)
2. stakeData.amount += amount might wrap or go too high
3. User now ranks #1 unfairly
4. Tier distribution becomes invalid (violates 20/30/50 rule)
5. Other users drop to Tier 3 or miss rewards

Recommended mitigation

Set a hard upper bound like:

```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_STAKE_AMOUNT = 10_000_000 * 1e18;
```

And then validate with:

```solidity
require(amount <= MAX_STAKE_AMOUNT, "Stake amount too large");
```
