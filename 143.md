# Medium Severity: WETH9.withdraw() lacks internal reentrancy protection

File: `edgen-staking/src/WETH9.sol`  
Line: 23

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 wad) public {
    require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= wad);
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= wad;
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(wad);
    emit Withdrawal(msg.sender, wad);
}
```

This function updates the `balanceOf` mapping after checking the balance, but **before** sending Ether to the caller using `.transfer()`.  
Although `transfer()` has a gas stipend of 2300 and is considered relatively safe, it **does not protect** against all forms of reentrancy in future Ethereum environments or via contract upgrades (e.g. if `.call()` is later used instead).

Without using a **reentrancy guard** or enforcing **checks-effects-interactions** strictly, there's a **latent risk** if the implementation changes or `.call()` is adopted.

---

🔐 **Impact**

- Enables potential **reentrancy attack surfaces** in future code upgrades.  
- Could lead to **unexpected recursive behavior** in forks or modified environments.  
- Lowers **defensive code quality** even if not currently exploitable.  

---

✅ **Recommendation**

Apply **checks-effects-interactions** pattern properly by reordering logic:  
Move the `transfer()` to the **end of the function**, **after** state updates and event emissions.  
Also consider using **OpenZeppelin’s ReentrancyGuard** if the contract is expected to grow in complexity.

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 wad) public {
    require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= wad);
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= wad;
    emit Withdrawal(msg.sender, wad);
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(wad);
}
```

**Alternatively, implement:**

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

contract WETH9 is ReentrancyGuard {
    // ...
    function withdraw(uint256 wad) public nonReentrant {
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= wad);
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= wad;
        emit Withdrawal(msg.sender, wad);
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(wad);
    }
}
```
