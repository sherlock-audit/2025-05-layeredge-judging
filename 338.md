# Unchecked Integer Underflow in FenwickTree.sol's update will cause Unfair Tier Demotion & Reward Loss

### Summary

Unchecked Integer Underflow in FenwickTree.sol's update will cause Unfair Tier Demotion & Reward Loss.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/library/FenwickTree.sol#L10
The `update` function code:
```Solidity
    function update(Tree storage self, uint256 index, int256 delta) internal {
        require(index > 0, "Index must be > 0");
        while (index <= self.size) {
            self.data[index] = uint256(int256(self.data[index]) + delta);
            index += lsb(index);
        }
    }
```

The FenwickTree.update() function mishandles negative deltas when a tree node's intermediate sum becomes zero before applying the negative delta, causing uint256(int256(0) - 1) which results in the node's value becoming type(uint256).max.


### Root Cause

The FenwickTree.update() function mishandles negative deltas when a tree node's intermediate sum becomes zero before applying the negative delta, causing uint256(int256(0) - 1) which results in the node's value becoming type(uint256).max.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The LayerEdgeStaking.sol contract is initialized, and its stakerTree (FenwickTree.Tree instance) is active with stakerTree.size set to MAX_USERS.
2. Multiple users have staked and unstaked over time, leading to a specific state in the stakerTree.data mapping.
3. A specific internal node stakerTree.data[k] (where k is a valid index within the Fenwick tree structure) must have a current value of 0. This state is achieved if previous update operations with positive and negative deltas affecting this node k have cumulatively summed to zero at stakerTree.data[k].
4. A user (target_user) is currently staked and active in the Fenwick tree (i.e., users[target_user_address].outOfTree == false and users[target_user_address].balance >= minStakeAmount).
5. The joinId of target_user (users[target_user_address].joinId) must be such that its update path in the Fenwick tree (when delta = -1 is applied) includes the aforementioned node k (where stakerTree.data[k] is currently 0).
target_user calls unstake(amount_to_unstake) (or unstakeNative) where amount_to_unstake is sufficient to bring users[target_user_address].balance below minStakeAmount.

### External Pre-conditions

Users (including potentially an attacker or normal users) perform a sequence of stake and unstake operations on LayerEdgeStaking.sol that leads to the specific internal pre-condition #3 (a Fenwick tree node stakerTree.data[k] becoming 0). This sequence is not reliant on external oracle prices or specific gas prices, but rather on the pattern of user interactions with the staking contract.

### Attack Path

1. State Setup: Through a series of stake and unstake operations (potentially orchestrated by an attacker controlling multiple accounts, or occurring through normal user activity), an internal Fenwick tree node stakerTree.data[k] (where k is a specific index in the tree's internal structure) has its value become 0.
2. Triggering User Action: A user, unstaker_user, whose joinId's update path in the Fenwick tree includes node k, performs an unstake operation. This operation is such that users[unstaker_user_address].balance drops below minStakeAmount, and users[unstaker_user_address].outOfTree was previously false.
3. Vulnerable Call: The LayerEdgeStaking.sol contract's internal _unstake function calls stakerTree.update(users[unstaker_user_address].joinId, -1).
4. Underflow Occurs: When the stakerTree.update function processes this call, its logic propagates the -1 delta. When it reaches node k (where stakerTree.data[k] is 0), the operation self.data[k] = uint256(int256(self.data[k]) + delta) becomes self.data[k] = uint256(int256(0) + int256(-1)). This evaluates to self.data[k] = uint256(-1), which sets stakerTree.data[k] to type(uint256).max. The Fenwick tree node k is now corrupted.
5. Victim's Tier Check: Another user, victim_user (who is currently staked and, let's assume, legitimately in Tier 1 or Tier 2), attempts to check their tier, or their tier is checked as part of an interest calculation or boundary adjustment. This involves calling LayerEdgeStaking.getCurrentTier(victim_user_address).
6. Corrupted Rank Calculation: Inside getCurrentTier, the function calculates rank = stakerTree.query(users[victim_user_address].joinId). If the summation path for users[victim_user_address].joinId in the stakerTree.query function includes the corrupted node k (which now holds type(uint256).max), the returned rank will be an astronomically large, incorrect value.
7. Incorrect Tier Assignment: The getCurrentTier function then calls _computeTierByRank(corrupted_rank, stakerCountInTree). Since corrupted_rank is much larger than stakerCountInTree (a correctly maintained counter of users in the tree), the condition rank > totalStakers in _computeTierByRank becomes true.
8. Victim Demoted: _computeTierByRank returns Tier.Tier3. Thus, victim_user is incorrectly classified as being in Tier 3.
9. Consequence for Victim: When victim_user claims rewards or has rewards calculated, the system uses the incorrect Tier 3 APY, leading to significantly lower rewards than they are entitled to.

### Impact

1. Victim stakers suffer a direct financial loss as they are unfairly demoted to Tier 3 (or a lower tier than deserved) due to the corrupted Fenwick tree returning an erroneously high rank for them. This results in them accruing and claiming rewards at a lower APY rate than they are legitimately entitled to.
2. The integrity of the tiering system is compromised. If _checkBoundariesAndRecord is called while the tree is corrupted, the stakerTree.findByCumulativeFrequency() calls may return incorrect joinIds (typically lower/earlier joinIds than actual for a given rank/cumulative frequency). This leads to tier updates being processed for the wrong users, or users near tier boundaries not being correctly transitioned, causing systemic mis-tiering.
Overall user trust in the fairness and correctness of the reward distribution mechanism is eroded.
