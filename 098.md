# Protocol will permanently lock users out of tier rewards despite meeting stake requirements

### Summary

The staking contract fails to re-evaluate outOfTree status when users increase their stake above minStakeAmount.
This will cause permanent loss of tier eligibility for restaking users as the protocol ignores their renewed qualifications.
Users who temporarily unstake below the threshold then restake above it.
The protocol's stake tracking system will incorrectly maintain outOfTree status.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L674

In _stake(), users are only added to the Fenwick Tree on their first deposit (when !user.isActive).

The outOfTree flag, set when users unstake below minStakeAmount, is never cleared even if balance later exceeds the threshold.

Example: User stakes 5 ETH (min=1 ETH), unstakes 4.5 ETH (balance=0.5 ETH â†’ outOfTree=true), then restakes 1 ETH (balance=1.5 ETH). They remain excluded from tiers.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Admin sets minStakeAmount > 0 (e.g., 1 ETH).

User stakes above threshold, then unstakes below it (triggering outOfTree).

User later restakes to exceed threshold again.

### External Pre-conditions

Protocol enforces tiered rewards based on stake amounts.

Users naturally adjust their staked amounts over time.

### Attack Path

User1 stakes 2 ETH (minStakeAmount = 1 ETH):

Added to Fenwick Tree (eligible for tiers)

User1 unstakes 1.5 ETH (balance = 0.5 ETH):

Marked outOfTree = true

Removed from Fenwick Tree

User1 restakes 1 ETH (balance = 1.5 ETH):

outOfTree remains true despite meeting criteria

Never re-added to Fenwick Tree

User1 permanently receives Tier3 APY despite qualifying for higher tiers.

### Impact

Users lose 30-70% of potential APY (difference between Tier1/2 and Tier3 rates).

Protocol violates its fairness guarantees for active restakers.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Re-evaluate outOfTree in _stake():
```solidity
function _stake(uint256 amount, address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
    UserInfo storage user = users[userAddr];
    
    if (user.outOfTree && (user.balance + amount) >= minStakeAmount) {
        user.outOfTree = false;
        stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1);
        stakerCountInTree++;
        stakerCountOutOfTree--;
    }
    // ... existing logic ...
}
```

Add Re-entry Check in _unstake():
```solidity
function _unstake(uint256 amount, address userAddr) internal {
    UserInfo storage user = users[userAddr];
    uint256 newBalance = user.balance - amount;
    
    if (!user.outOfTree && newBalance < minStakeAmount) {
        // Only set outOfTree if not already set
        user.outOfTree = true;
        // ... existing removal logic ...
    }
}
```
