# Malicious user would exploit the Tier change by staking below minimum

## Summary
When staking if its the staker first time he starts to earn an APY rate of 10% then protocol upgrades the rate for how long the user stakes in the Protocol. However this is broken when the user first stake is below `minStakeAmount` allowing him to move to Tier 3! then re-staking with higher amount above to increase balance allowing him to earn APY for tier 3.

## Description
In the competition docs 
>> Interest calculation accuracy: User rewards must be calculated correctly based on their tier history, time staked, and APY rates

However this would break the APY order by skipping two Tiers APY rate and raising to the highest Tier earning a large sum rate of 50% for stake.

```solidity
 @>       Tier tier = Tier.Tier3;

        //Staking for first time and amount is less than minStakeAmount, user will be in tier 3 permanently and out of the tree
        if (!user.isActive && amount < minStakeAmount) {
            stakerCountOutOfTree++;
            user.isActive = true;
            user.outOfTree = true;
   @>         _recordTierChange(userAddr, tier);
        }
```
As we can see it raises the tier to Tier3
## Attack Path
1. User stakes below `minStakeAmount` this would raise him to `Tier 3`
2. Then user restakes above `minStakeAmount` 
3. When compound interest is called his period interest would be calculated using APY rate for Tier 3  
4. The user begins earning unfair APY rate
## Recommended Mitigation
Revert on minimum stake
