# Broken core protocol Invariant

### Summary

In the README of the protocol in the invariant sections it is stated that the Tier distribution should be as follows:
>Tier distribution correctness: Exactly 20% in Tier 1, 30% in Tier 2, and 50% in Tier 3 (with minimum guarantees of at least 1 user per tier when applicable)

However in the initialize() function, the rate for the second tier is set to 35%

### Root Cause

The initialize() function sets rate for the second tier to 35%

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The initialize() function is called, the values are hardcoded there

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

The initialize() function is called, it is something that can't be avoided

### Impact

Broken protocol invariant

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
