# Incorrect Minimum Stake Amount for Native ETH in LayerEdgeStaking Contract

### Summary

The LayerEdgeStaking contract uses the same `minStakeAmount` variable (set to `3000 * 1e18`) for both EDGEN token and native ETH staking. This results in an unintended requirement of 3000 ETH for native staking, making it practically impossible for users to stake with ETH while maintaining the intended 3000 EDGEN token requirement for token staking.


### Root Cause

The contract uses a single minStakeAmount variable for both staking methods:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L692

### Internal Pre-conditions

Contract deployed with default `minStakeAmount` or any amount.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

#### Native ETH Staking Attempt:

- User attempts to stake native ETH
- Contract checks against `minStakeAmount` (3000 * 1e18)
- User must provide 3000 ETH (approximately $6,000,000 at $2000/ETH)
- Staking becomes practically impossible

### Impact

High Severity: Functionality break
Financial Impact: Makes native ETH staking practically impossible
System Integrity: Unfair advantage for EDGEN token stakers

### PoC

The staking token needs to implement WETH.

```solidity

function testNativeETHStakingMinimum() public {
        // Setup
        address bereket = makeAddr("bereket");

        uint256 minStakeAmount = staking.minStakeAmount();
        
        // Try to stake with less than minimum
        vm.deal(bereket, 1 ether);
        vm.startPrank(bereket);
        
        // Should fail as 1 ETH < 3000 ETH
        vm.expectRevert();
        staking.stakeNative{value: 1 ether}();
        
        // Try to stake with minimum
        vm.deal(bereket, 3000 ether);
        staking.stakeNative{value: 3000 ether}();
    }

```

### Mitigation

Implement separate minimum amounts for different assets:

```solidity

uint256 public minStakeAmountToken;  // For EDGEN token
uint256 public minStakeAmountETH;    // For native ETH

function initialize(address _stakingToken, address _admin) public initializer {
    // ...
    minStakeAmountToken = 3000 * 1e18;  // 3000 EDGEN tokens
    minStakeAmountETH = 1.5 ether;      // 1.5 ETH (or appropriate amount)
}

function _stake(uint256 amount, address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
    // ...
    if (!isNative) {
        require(amount >= minStakeAmountToken, "Amount below minimum token stake");
    } else {
        require(amount >= minStakeAmountETH, "Amount below minimum ETH stake");
    }
    // ...
}

```
