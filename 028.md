# User can bypass UNSTAKE_WINDOW for compounded rewards allowing their premature withdrawal

### Summary

The `compoundInterest` [function ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L213)adds accrued rewards to a user's staked principal (`user.balance`) but does not update `user.depositTime`. The `unstake` function's lock-up check, `block.timestamp >= user.depositTime + UNSTAKE_WINDOW`, relies on this `depositTime`, which is only set during explicit `stake` operations. Consequently, if a user's initial `UNSTAKE_WINDOW` has elapsed, any subsequently compounded rewards can be withdrawn immediately, as they inherit the old `depositTime` and are not subject to a new lock-up period starting from the moment they were compounded.

### Root Cause

The `user.depositTime` field is not updated within the `compoundInterest` function when rewards are added to the user's principal balance. The `unstake` time-lock therefore only considers the timestamp of the last explicit `stake` operation, not the time at which rewards were compounded into principal.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.  `compoundingEnabled` is `true`.
2.  User has an active stake with accrued rewards.
3.  The contract's `rewardsReserve` is sufficient.
4.  The `UNSTAKE_WINDOW` for the user's *last explicit stake* (which set `depositTime`) has passed.

### External Pre-conditions

1.  `block.timestamp` has advanced such that the `UNSTAKE_WINDOW` from the user's last explicit stake has elapsed.

### Attack Path

1.  User Alice stakes `initialAmount` at `T_stake`. `users[Alice].depositTime` becomes `T_stake`.
2.  Alice waits for `UNSTAKE_WINDOW` (e.g., 7 days) to pass relative to `T_stake`.
3.  At time `T_compound` (where `T_compound >= T_stake + UNSTAKE_WINDOW`), Alice calls `compoundInterest()`. `rewardAmount` is added to her balance, but `users[Alice].depositTime` remains `T_stake`.
4.  Immediately after, Alice calls `unstake(rewardAmount)`.
5.  The check `block.timestamp (approx. T_compound) >= users[Alice].depositTime (T_stake) + UNSTAKE_WINDOW` passes.
6.  Alice successfully withdraws `rewardAmount`, which was only added to principal at `T_compound`, without it being subject to its own `UNSTAKE_WINDOW` from `T_compound`.

### Impact

*   **Weakened Lock-up:** The `UNSTAKE_WINDOW`'s effectiveness is reduced for capital originating from compounded rewards.
*   **Premature Withdrawal:** Users can access (and potentially sell) compounded portions of their stake sooner than if those portions were subject to a fresh lock-up period from the time of compounding.
*   **Deviation from Expectation:** The behavior may contradict the intended design if all new principal is expected to be locked for the `UNSTAKE_WINDOW` duration from the moment it's added.
*   **Potential Economic Implications:** Could slightly undermine strategies aimed at token stability or long-term holding if the window is designed to delay the liquidity of rewards.
