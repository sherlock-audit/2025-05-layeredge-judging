# Fenwick Tree Misuse Risk

### Summary

The Fenwick (BIT) library is powerful but prone to off-by-one or out-of-bounds errors if indices are mis-calculated.

### Root Cause

Index arithmetic (i += i & -i) not clearly documented.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Mass stake/unstake operations around index 0 or MAX_USERS.

### External Pre-conditions

User count approaches the 100-million limit.

### Attack Path

An update on index 0 or MAX_USERS causes a silent fail or corrupts the tree state.

### Impact

High: incorrect ranking, possible denial of reward claims or permanent state corruption.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

â€¢ Add explicit require(index > 0 && index <= MAX_USERS).
â€¢ Include boundary tests at 1, 2, MAX_USERS-1, and MAX_USERS.
