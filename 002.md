# Irrevocable “Out-of-Tree” State Breaks Tier Incentives

### Summary

The irreversible outOfTree flag will cause permanent Tier-3 rewards for returning stakers, as any user who once drops below the minStakeAmount and later deposits again will never be re-inserted into the ranking tree.

### Root Cause

In LayerEdgeStaking.sol, _unstake()
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/029b25ca38242ac844f5289547dc759ad2eb308b/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L742C1-L751C10
```solidity
user.outOfTree = true;
```

whenever user.balance < minStakeAmount.

In the subsequent _stake() flow the branch that re-inserts a staker into the Fenwick tree is gated by
```solidity
if (!user.isActive && amount >= minStakeAmount) { … }
```

Since user.isActive is already true, the user is never added back to the tree, leaving outOfTree unchanged.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.	A staker has already joined the tree (user.isActive == true, user.outOfTree == false).
2.	The staker’s balance is reduced below minStakeAmount via unstake(), setting user.outOfTree = true.
3.	Later, the same staker calls stake() with an amount such that balance + amount ≥ minStakeAmount.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1.	Alice stakes minStakeAmount + 1 tokens  →  enters Tier 1 / 2.
2.	Alice calls unstake() for enough tokens to leave < minStakeAmount.
•_unstake() marks outOfTree = true, removes her from the Fenwick tree.
3.	Alice immediately (or any time later) calls stake() with a large deposit (≫ minStakeAmount).
•_stake() skips the “insert into tree” branch because user.isActive == true.
4.	Subsequent reward or tier queries treat Alice as Tier 3 forever.

### Impact

The staker (Alice) suffers a permanent loss of Tier 1 / 2 APY, significantly reducing long-term yield.
At protocol level, Tier 1 + Tier 2 head-counts drift downward over time, breaking the advertised incentive structure.

### PoC
```solidity
// assume testing with Foundry
alice.stake(minStakeAmount + 1 ether);   // Tier 1
alice.unstake(2 ether);                 // drops below minStakeAmount
vm.warp(block.timestamp + 8 days);      // satisfy UNSTAKE_WINDOW
alice.stake(100 ether);                 // large restake

assert(staking.getCurrentTier(alice) == Tier.Tier3);  // still Tier 3
```
### Mitigation

Add re-admission logic inside _stake():
```solidity
if (user.outOfTree && user.balance + amount >= minStakeAmount) {
    user.outOfTree = false;
    stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1);
    stakerCountOutOfTree--;
    stakerCountInTree++;
    _recordTierChange(userAddr, _computeTierByRank(
        stakerTree.query(user.joinId), stakerCountInTree
    ));
    _checkBoundariesAndRecord(false);
}
```
