# Token Assumptions Too Permissive

### Summary

The codebase assumes all ERC-20 tokens (and EDGEN’s Permit extension) behave “by the book,” but doesn’t blacklist fee-on-transfer or rebasing tokens.

### Root Cause

No runtime checks on transferFrom() balances or emitted Transfer amounts.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Stake/unstake functions call token transfers without post-transfer balance verification.

### External Pre-conditions

Integration of a non-standard token (fee-on-transfer, rebasing) into the staking contract.

### Attack Path

A malicious token could deduct extra fees on transfer(), causing discrepancies between recorded and actual staked balances.

### Impact

Medium: results in incorrect accounting of user stakes and potential fund shortfalls.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

• After every transferFrom(), verify token.balanceOf(this) increased by the expected amount.
• Explicitly whitelist only audited token addresses.
