# Total reward inconsistent per token staked

### Summary

Within the system we calculate total reward base on the following factors:

1)Tier APY
2)Balance of the user
3)Amount of users

At this point it's obvious total reward is inconsistent, meaning, for same amount of token staked contract could pay different reward
An example:
consider there 100k token staked
consider t1APY = 10%, t2APY = 5%, t3APY = 1%.
In case 1 there is a whale within t1 who staked 90k in t1, someone who staked 5k in t2 and rest of 5k in t3
In that case protocol will pay 9k + 250 + 50 = 9300 tokens for 100k  staked
In case 2 there are 5k at t1, 5k at t2, 90k at t3 - we will pay 500 + 250 + 900 = 1650 for 100k tokens staked

 

### Root Cause

It is impossible to accurately predict the amount of the reward within the system.
reward per user calculating the following way, it doesn't determined by some stable amount of reward
LayerEdgeStaking.sol
```solidity
calculateUnclaimedInterest(){
...
((user.balance * apy * (periodEnd - periodStart)) / (SECONDS_IN_YEAR * PRECISION)) / 100;
...
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Let's consider the following case:
1)each user had 300 tokens staked within the system
2)APY + reward pool was adjusted to cover enough rewards for the users
3)User Alice was promoted to t1 and staked additional 100k of tokens
4) After some period Alice won't be able either compound or claimed it's interested because it won't be enough reward within the contract 
Adjusting APY at this point will scare away another stakers

### Impact

Potential overspending for protocol and DoS of reward for big stakers
Protocol will be unable to balance APY between to reflect big&small stakers needs
Considering it stated in program description that there is no offchain mechanism then APY supposed to be adjusted manually and, hence, could lead to dos for users
