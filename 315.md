# `setMinStakeAmount()` does not apply the new `minStakeAmount` to existing positions

### Summary

The owner can call the following function to change the minStakeAmount:
```solidity
function setMinStakeAmount(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        minStakeAmount = amount;
    } 
```
However, the new minStakeAmount is not applied to the existing positions, allowing users below the new minStakeAmount to earn higher APYs.

### Root Cause

The `minStakeAmount` is not applied to existing positions.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Owner calls setMinStakeAmount

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. User creates a positions with an amount ==minStakeAmount. The user enters Tier1
2. Owner calls `setMinStakeAmount` increasing the minStakeAmount.
3. User does not meet the requirements but is still in Tier1, earning a higher APY.

### Impact

1. When the owner increases the minStakeAmount, existing positions that met the previous minStakeAmount requirement will still earn higher APY and be in the first/second tier, while they have less than the current minStakeAmount
2. When the owner reduces the minStakeAmount, some users will not pass the new minStakeAmount requirement but be ineligble for the higher tier and apy.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider implementing a way to apply the new minStakeAmount for existing positions
