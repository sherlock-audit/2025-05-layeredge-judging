# `call()` should be used instead of `transfer()` on an address payable

## Vulnerability Details

We can see that the [WETH9::withdraw#L29](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/WETH9.sol#L29) function uses `transfer` on a payable address to send ETH.

The `payable(address).transfer(amount)` function forwards a fixed amount of 2300 gas.

So, as a result, users can not withdraw their funds, as described in the `Impact` section.
Also see the `Note` section under the `Impact` section.

```Solidity
    function withdraw(uint256 wad) public {
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= wad);
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= wad;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(wad); // ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ
        emit Withdrawal(msg.sender, wad);
    }
```

## Impact

The use of the deprecated transfer() function for an address will inevitably make the transaction fail when:

* The claimer smart contract does not implement a payable function.

* The claimer smart contract does implement a payable fallback which uses more than 2300 gas unit.

* The claimer smart contract implements a payable fallback function that needs less than 2300 gas units but is called through proxy, raising the call's gas usage above 2300.

* Additionally, using higher than 2300 gas might be mandatory for some multisig wallets.

## Note

#### On [Sherlock Judging guideline doc](https://docs.sherlock.xyz/audits/judging/guidelines#vii.-list-of-issue-categories-that-are-not-considered-valid) it says,

10. Issues assuming future opcode gas repricing are not considered to be of Medium/High severity.
Use of call vs transfer will be considered as a protocol design choice if there is no good reason why the call may consume more than 2300 gas without opcode repricings.

So I correctly give valid reasons why the call may consume more than 2300 gas without opcode repricings on the impact section.



#### Also, now you can say,
User do not directly lose their ability to withdraw as there is `approve` function on WETH9 contract.
And after `approve` user can transfer it to another account.

Well, my answer is,
What if the user is only bound to withdraw from the account that they deposited?
This can happen to let's say, on a multisig / smart contract where they only trust the multisig / smart contract not any other account.

#### So I proved that it should definitely use `payable(address).call` instead of `transfer`

### Also on the [Doc - LayerEdgeStaking.md#potential-attack-vectors](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/docs/LayerEdgeStaking.md#potential-attack-vectors) it says

#### Potential Attack Vectors
 
4. Native Token Vulnerabilities
* ETH/WETH conversion attacks
* Direct ETH transfer vulnerabilities ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ
* Potential balance tracking issues

On the [WETH9::withdraw#L29](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/WETH9.sol#L29) direct ETH transfer is done on the `withdraw` function.

## Attack Path

* There is a user 'A' who is a Multisig or Smart Contract
* Now, user 'A' deposits 200 ETH by calling `deposit`, and his account balance gets updated
* Some time has passed
* Now the user 'A' wants to `withdraw` his 200 ETH
* He calls the `withdraw` function, but it failed as he was a Multisig / Smart Contract and needed more than 2300 gas to receive.
* He cannot even call the `approve` function and then transfer to another address, as the individuals who control 'A' only trust 'A', not any other address.
* So his funds remain stuck.

## Recommendation

Using `call` with its returned boolean checked in combination with re-entrancy guard is highly recommended after December 2019.

```Diff
-  payable(msg.sender).transfer(wad);
+ (bool success, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{ value: wad}("");
+ require(success, " Transfer of ETH Failed");
```
