# Protocol updates to minStakeAmount only take effect for existing stakers when they perform an unstake() operation.

### Summary

When the protocol updates `minStakeAmount`, existing stakers are not immediately affected. Some users may continue to have `user.balance < minStakeAmount` yet still retain their current Tier status. These users can call `stake()`,` stakeNative()`, or `compoundInterest()` without triggering a Tier downgrade.

However, the `unstake()` function does enforce the check:

```solidity
if (!user.outOfTree && user.balance < minStakeAmount) {
            // execute this before removing from tree, this will make sure to calculate interest
            //for amount left after unstake
            _recordTierChange(userAddr, Tier.Tier3);
            stakerTree.update(user.joinId, -1);
            stakerCountInTree--;
            user.outOfTree = true;
            stakerCountOutOfTree++;
            _checkBoundariesAndRecord(true);
        }
```

### Root Cause
These methods currently lack the Tier validation.

### Attack Path

1. Alice stakes 3000e18 `EDGEN` tokens.
2. Protocol changes `minStakeAmount = 5000e18`.
3. Alice can continue to use `stake()`, `stakeNative()`, and `compoundInterest()` while keeping her Tier status despite holding less than the current minimum stake amount.

### Impact

This behavior gives unfair advantages to older users, allowing them to maintain higher APY tiers without meeting the current minimum staking requirement.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the same Tier validation check from `unstake()` to the `stake()`, `stakeNative()`, and `compoundInterest()` methods. This ensures Tier enforcement remains consistent across all staking-related actions.
