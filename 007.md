# Attacker will steal all user rewards through compound interest manipulation

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L197

## Summary

**The missing debt tracking update in `compoundInterest()` will cause complete loss of rewards for legitimate users as an attacker will exploit the interest calculation flaw to claim rewards they haven't earned**

## Root Cause

**In `compoundInterest()` function lines 66-87, the function updates `user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp` and resets `user.interestEarned = 0` but fails to properly update the user's debt ratio in the interest calculation system, allowing the user to compound interest and then immediately claim more interest based on the increased balance**

```solidity
function compoundInterest() external whenCompoundingEnabled nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    _updateInterest(msg.sender);
    UserInfo storage user = users[msg.sender];
    uint256 claimable = user.interestEarned;
    require(claimable > 0, "Nothing to compound");
    require(rewardsReserve >= claimable, "Insufficient rewards in contract");
    
    rewardsReserve -= claimable;
    user.balance += claimable;        // Balance increased
    totalStaked += claimable;
    
    user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;  // Reset claim time
    user.interestEarned = 0;               // Reset interest
    user.totalClaimed += claimable;
    // MISSING: Update of debt tracking for new balance
}
```

## Internal Pre-conditions

1.  Compounding needs to be enabled by admin (`compoundingEnabled = true`)
2.  User needs to have accumulated some interest (`user.interestEarned > 0`)
3.  Contract needs to have sufficient rewards reserve
4.  User needs to be in an active staking state

## External Pre-conditions

1.  Block timestamp needs to advance enough to accumulate meaningful interest
2.  No other users need to be claiming simultaneously (to ensure rewards reserve availability)

## Attack Path

1.  **Attacker stakes tokens and waits to accumulate interest**
2.  **Attacker calls `compoundInterest()` to add earned interest to their staked balance**
3.  **The function increases `user.balance` but only resets `lastClaimTime`, not updating debt tracking**
4.  **Attacker immediately calls `_updateInterest()` again (through another function)**
5.  **The interest calculation treats the increased balance as if it was staked from `lastClaimTime`**
6.  **Attacker can now claim additional interest based on the compounded amount**
7.  **Repeat this process to drain the rewards reserve**

## Impact

**The rewards reserve suffers complete depletion as the attacker gains exponentially increasing rewards. Legitimate users lose access to their earned rewards due to insufficient contract balance.**
