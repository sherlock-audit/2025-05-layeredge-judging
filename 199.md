# Users can unwillingly get removed out of the staker tree by an admin

### Summary

If an admin accidentally increases `minStakeAmount` right before a user unstakes some tokens while still staking more than previous `minStakeAmount` but less than the new `minStakeAmount`, the user gets unexpectedly removed out of the tree and potentially has his APY reduced.

### Root Cause

The users don't have any way of protecting themselves from getting accidentally removed out of the tree.
```solidity
    function _unstake(uint256 amount, address userAddr) internal {
        UserInfo storage user = users[userAddr];

        // require(user.isActive, "No active stake");
        require(user.balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        // Update interest before changing balance
        _updateInterest(userAddr);

        // Update user balances
        user.balance -= amount;
        user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;

        // Update total staked
        totalStaked -= amount;

>       if (!user.outOfTree && user.balance < minStakeAmount) {
            // execute this before removing from tree, this will make sure to calculate interest
            //for amount left after unstake
            _recordTierChange(userAddr, Tier.Tier3);
            stakerTree.update(user.joinId, -1);
            stakerCountInTree--;
            user.outOfTree = true;
            stakerCountOutOfTree++;
            _checkBoundariesAndRecord(true);
        }

        // Add unstake request instead of immediate transfer
        unstakeRequests[userAddr].push(UnstakeRequest({amount: amount, timestamp: block.timestamp, completed: false}));

        emit UnstakedQueued(userAddr, unstakeRequests[userAddr].length - 1, amount);
    }

The contest README also states: 
`The owner of the protocol can change the following data:`

`minStakeAmount:`
`No upper limit (could potentially be set so high that new staking becomes impossible)`
So any user is vulnerable to this problem.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Assume Alice's staked balance is 4500 * 1e18, Alice is in Tier 1, `minStakeAmount` is 3000 * 1e18.
1. Alice unstakes 1000 * 1e18 tokens and expects to have more than `minStakeAmount` and to stay in Tier 1.
2. Admin accidentally frontruns Alice with a setMinStakeAmount(4000 * 1e18) call.
3. Alice's balance becomes less than new `minStakeAmount` so she gets removed from the tree and gets demoted to Tier 3
If there are many stakers in the tree, Alice has very few chances of getting back to Tier 1 even with another address

### Impact

The users directly lose rewards as their APY is decreased

### PoC

```solidity
    function test_POC() public {
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        token.approve(address(staking), 4500 * 1e18); 
        staking.stake(4500 * 1e18);
        vm.stopPrank();

        (, LayerEdgeStaking.Tier tier, , ) = staking.getUserInfo(alice);
        assertEq(uint256(tier), uint256(LayerEdgeStaking.Tier.Tier1));

        vm.prank(admin);
        staking.setMinStakeAmount(4000 * 1e18);

        vm.prank(alice);
        staking.unstake(1000 * 1e18);

        (uint256 balance, LayerEdgeStaking.Tier tier, , ) = staking.getUserInfo(alice);
        assertGt(balance, MIN_STAKE); // Alice's stake is greater than initial minStakeAmount
        assertEq(uint256(tier), uint256(LayerEdgeStaking.Tier.Tier3)); // but she is demoted to tier 3
    }
```

### Mitigation

For example, an additional parameter can be provided to unstake() that lets users indicate whether they intend on removing themselves from the tree
