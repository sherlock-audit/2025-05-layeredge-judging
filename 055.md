# Users are locked out of interest claims when rewards are depleted

### Summary

When a user calls [claimInterest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L765-L793), the contract checks `require(rewardsReserve >= claimable)`. 

If earlier claimants have drained the reward pool below a user’s accrued interest, every subsequent claim will revert, permanently freezing all outstanding rewards with no partial or deferred payout

### Root Cause

Interest is accumulated in `user.interestEarned` without regard for the on-chain `rewardsReserve`. In `_claimInterest`, there is no logic to:

1. Allow partial payouts when the pool is under-funded
2. Track “debt” for later fulfilment
3. Automatically top up or reconcile a shortfall

Thus, once `rewardsReserve` falls below any claimant’s full entitlement, all future calls to `claimInterest` and `compoundInterest` revert.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- Users accrue `interestEarned` via `_updateInterest(...)` regardless of `rewardsReserve` size 
- A claimant depletes `rewardsReserve` below other users’ `interestEarned`.

### External Pre-conditions

- The contract owner deposits a finite token amount into `rewardsReserve` via `depositRewards(...)`.
- Total accrued interest across users eventually exceeds that deposited reserve.

### Attack Path

1. Owner funds `rewardsReserve` with a limited amount.
2. Users stake and earn interest over time.
3. User A calls `claimInterest` (or `compoundInterest`) and reduces `rewardsReserve` to zero (or below other users’ claims).
4. User B later calls `claimInterest`. The `require(rewardsReserve >= claimable)` check fails, reverting the transaction.
5. All subsequent claim attempts by any user revert, locking their accrued rewards indefinitely.

### Impact

**DOS:** All outstanding interest claims become permanently unclaimable (i.e., locked for longer than one week).
Per Sherlock’s DOS criteria (section V), meeting “funds locked for more than a week” qualifies this as Medium severity.
