# Tier-1 APY Gaming via Immutable `joinId` in Fenwick Tree

### Summary

The staking contract assigns each user a fixed `joinId` (and thereby a tree rank) when they first stake at least `minStakeAmount`. The Fenwick tree tracks only “one vote” per active staker, never updating that vote when the user later increases or decreases their balance. An attacker can stake the bare minimum early to secure rank 1, then deposit a massive balance later—enjoying Tier 1 APY on their huge balance, while honest large stakers arriving later are relegated to lower tiers.


### Root Cause


- The Fenwick tree is initialized once per user with weight = 1 at first qualifying stake (`minStakeAmount`), and never updated on subsequent stakes/unstakes.  
- Rank (and thus tier) is based solely on the static tree vote order, not on current balances.  
- `joinId` is immutable, so a minimal early deposit locks in the best rank forever.

### Internal Pre-conditions


1. `stakerTree.update(joinId, +1)` is called only once per user—upon first stake ≥ `minStakeAmount`.  
2. No subsequent calls to `update(…, delta)` adjust the user’s weight when they top up their stake.  
3. Tier computation uses `rank = stakerTree.query(joinId)` and never rebalances on stake amount changes.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The attacker can interact with the contract before large whales arrive.  
2. The attacker has at least `minStakeAmount` of the staking token.  
3. Whales or honest users stake after the attacker’s minimal deposit.


### Attack Path


1. Attacker deploys wallet A.  
2. A calls `stake(minStakeAmount)` → `joinId = 1`, `stakerTree.update(1, +1)`, Tier 1.  
3. Later, A calls `stake(1 000 000)` → user’s `balance` jumps but Fenwick tree unchanged → still rank 1 → still Tier 1 (50% APY).  
4. Whale B stakes 1 000 000 → `joinId = 2`, rank 2 → Tier 2 or 3 (35%/20% APY).  
5. Attacker’s huge balance now accrues 50% APY, draining rewards in Tier 1.


### Impact


- **Economic loss**: An attacker can earn excessive rewards (50% APY) on an arbitrarily large balance, draining the reward pool.  
- **Unfairness**: Honest large stakers are forced into lower tiers despite much larger deposits.  
- **Denial of service**: Tier 1 may always be saturated by Sybil‐resistant minimal deposits, locking out genuine early adopters.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


1. **Weight by Balance**  
   - On every `stake()` or `unstake()`, compute `delta = newBalance − oldBalance` and call `stakerTree.update(joinId, int(delta))`.  
   - Then rank = “sum of all tokens staked with lower joinId,” so larger balances naturally sort ahead.  
2. **Re-insert on Top-up**  
   - Remove the user’s old weight (`−1`), then re-insert with weight proportional to balance (or keep weight = 1 but re-sort by timestamp + balance).
