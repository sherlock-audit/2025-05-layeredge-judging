# Unrestricted Admin Control over APY rates and rewards reserve withdrawal

### Summary

The LayerEdge Staking contract is designed to facilitate staking on both Ethereum and the LayerEdge L1 chain, using a tiered FCFS (First Come First Served) reward system. The contract supports staking with an ERC20 token and wrapped native tokens (WETH9). It features a fixed tier distribution (20%, 30%, 50%) managed through a Fenwick Tree data structure for efficient user ranking and tier boundary management. Historical APY rates and user tier histories are tracked to accurately calculate rewards over time.


### Root Cause

Several critical issues were identified relating to unchecked admin privileges, potential reentrancy vulnerabilities, and the complexity of tier updates. Specifically, the admin's ability to change APY rates and withdraw from the rewards reserve without strict limits could lead to abuse. The Fenwick Tree implementation requires careful boundary checks to prevent inconsistencies. Interest calculation logic must correctly handle tier changes and APY updates to prevent incorrect reward distribution.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.	The smart contract is deployed on Ethereum and LayerEdge L1 chains.
2.	Admin roles have permission to update APY rates and manage reward reserves.
3.     The staking token follows the ERC20Permit standard on Ethereum; WETH9 on LayerEdge.
4.	Users stake amounts above the minimum stake to qualify for tiers.
5.	Fenwick Tree size is fixed and cannot be adjusted post-deployment.


### External Pre-conditions

1.	No external protocols are integrated.
2.	No off-chain bots or services influence contract state.
3.	Users interact through standard wallets and UI interfaces.
4.	Network conditions follow typical blockchain constraints (gas limits, block times).


### Attack Path

1. An attacker could exploit unchecked admin functions to set excessively high APY rates or drain the reward reserve.

2. Reentrancy attacks could occur if state changes are not properly sequenced before external calls during unstaking or claiming rewards.

3. Complex tier boundary updates could be manipulated to create incorrect user ranks or unfair reward distributions if Fenwick Tree updates are improperly handled.

### Impact

If exploited, attackers or malicious admins could cause severe financial loss to users by draining reward funds, unfairly distributing rewards, or corrupting tier rankings. Users might receive incorrect interest payments, resulting in loss of trust and reputational damage to the protocol.

        vm.stopPrank();

        assertEq(staking.rewardsReserveBalance(), 0);
    }
}


### Mitigation

Implement upper bounds on APY values per tier. Use a timelock or multisig for withdrawFromRewardsReserve() and restrict maximum withdrawal amount per epoch. Emit events for all APY and reserve changes for transparency.
