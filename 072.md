# MEV Risks in Tier Assignment System

# Summary
The sequential processing in tier assignments in [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L466-L516](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L466-L516) will cause financial losses for stakers as MEV bots can sandwich transactions to manipulate tier placements and extract value.

## Root Cause
In [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L466-L516](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L466-L516) the stake function processes tier assignments sequentially:

```solidity
function _stake(uint256 amount, address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
    // ... 
    if (!user.isActive && amount >= minStakeAmount) {
        user.joinId = nextJoinId++;  // @audit Sequential ID assignment
        stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1);
        stakerCountInTree++;
        // @audit Tier assignment happens after state changes
        tier = _computeTierByRank(rank, stakerCountInTree);
    }
}
```

This predictable state change pattern allows MEV bots to sandwich transactions for optimal tier placement. The vulnerability is compounded by the lack of MEV protection in [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L729-L738](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L729-L738):

```solidity
function _computeTierByRank(uint256 rank, uint256 totalStakers) internal pure returns (Tier) {
    if (rank == 0 || rank > totalStakers) return Tier.Tier3;
    (uint256 tier1Count, uint256 tier2Count,) = getTierCountForStakerCount(totalStakers);
    if (rank <= tier1Count) return Tier.Tier1;
    else if (rank <= tier1Count + tier2Count) return Tier.Tier2;
    return Tier.Tier3;
}
```

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. Contract must have sufficient stakers to make tier manipulation profitable
2. Tier boundaries must be near transition points
3. APY difference between tiers must be significant enough to make MEV profitable

## External Pre-conditions
1. MEV infrastructure must be available
2. Network must allow for transaction reordering
3. Gas prices must be low enough to make MEV profitable

## Attack Path
1. MEV bot monitors mempool for large stake transactions
2. When large stake detected, bot front-runs with larger stake to secure Tier1
3. Original transaction gets processed, pushed to lower tier
4. Bot back-runs with unstake, extracting value from temporary tier position
5. Process can be repeated for consistent profit

## Impact
The stakers suffer direct financial losses through suboptimal tier placement and reduced APY earnings. MEV bots can extract value by manipulating the tier system, effectively stealing higher APY positions from legitimate users.

        // Victim transaction
        vm.prank(victim);
        staking.stake{value: NORMAL_STAKE}();
        assertEq(uint(staking.getUserTier(victim)), uint(Tier.Tier2));

        vm.prank(attacker);
        staking.unstake(LARGE_STAKE);
        
        // Verify victim remains in lower tier
        assertEq(uint(staking.getUserTier(victim)), uint(Tier.Tier2));
    }
}
```

## Mitigation
1. Implement time-weighted tier assignments in [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L729](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L729):

```solidity
struct StakeInfo {
    uint256 amount;
    uint256 timestamp;
    uint256 weightedScore;
}

function calculateTierScore(address user) internal view returns (uint256) {
    StakeInfo storage info = stakes[user];
    uint256 timeWeight = block.timestamp - info.timestamp;
    return info.amount * timeWeight;
}
```

2. Add minimum stake duration before tier eligibility
3. Implement anti-MEV measures like commit-reveal
4. Consider using Flashbots Protect or similar MEV protection
5. Add penalties for rapid unstaking
