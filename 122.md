# [H-01] Front-running Vulnerability in stake() and unstake() Functions Allows Manipulation of Reward Distribution

### Summary

The stake() and unstake() functions in LayerEdgeStaking.sol are susceptible to front-running. Malicious actors can monitor pending transactions and reorder their own with higher gas fees, allowing them to unfairly enter or exit the staking pool before others. This can result in unjust reward distribution, undermining the fairness and integrity of the staking protocol.

### Root Cause

The staking contract performs immediate state changes in the stake() and unstake() functions without enforcing timing or ordering protections. Because these are public and directly update reward and balance states, they can be exploited by transactions ordered by gas price. This vulnerability stems from three key design flaws in the staking mechanism:

1. **Real-Time Tier Recalculation**
In [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L700-L713](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L700-L713) tiers are recalculated immediately during stake/unstake operations using the Fenwick tree’s instantaneous ranking

2. **Mempool-Exposed State Changes**
In [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L740-L755](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L740-L755) Stake/unstake transactions reveal critical state changes (e.g., stakerCountInTree, totalStaked) before execution

3. **Lack of Time Averaging**
In [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L355-L373](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L355-L373) tier assignments rely on instantaneous snapshots instead of time-weighted averages

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The staking logic calculates rewards using the current balance and rewardPerTokenStored at the moment of calling stake()/unstake().
2. No delay or validation of the order of staking events exists.

### External Pre-conditions

1. A user submits a stake() or unstake() transaction.
2. An attacker has access to mempool data and can submit a similar transaction with a higher gas price.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker monitors pending transactions in mempool
2. Identifies stake/unstake operations that will affect tier boundaries
3. Submits higher-gas transaction with favorable stake/unstake amount
4. The attacker’s transaction executes first.
5. Attacker maintains higher APY tier while victim gets lower rewards

### Impact

1. Unfair reward allocation.
2. Incentives skewed toward attackers using MEV strategies.
3. Honest long-term stakers are disadvantaged.
4. Damage to trust and protocol integrity.

### PoC

```solidity
// Attack scenario 1: Front-running a stake
1. Alice sends stake(1000) - would put her at rank 100 (Tier1 boundary)
2. Bob sees tx in mempool
3. Bob sends stake(1001) with higher gas fee
4. Bob's stake executes first, gets rank 100 (Tier1)
5. Alice's stake executes, gets rank 101 (Tier2)

// Attack scenario 2: Front-running an unstake
1. Alice sends unstake(500) - would move her out of Tier1
2. Bob sees tx in mempool
3. Bob sends unstake(501) with higher gas fee
4. Bob's unstake executes first, maintains Tier1
5. Alice's unstake executes, drops to Tier2
```

### Mitigation

**1. Implement a commit-reveal scheme for staking actions to prevent transaction visibility from influencing tier allocation.**
```solidity
mapping(address => bytes32) public stakingCommitments;
mapping(address => uint256) public commitmentExpiry;

function commitStake(bytes32 commitmentHash) external {
    stakingCommitments[msg.sender] = commitmentHash;
    commitmentExpiry[msg.sender] = block.timestamp + 3600; // 1 hour window
}

function revealAndStake(uint256 amount, uint256 salt) external nonReentrant {
    bytes32 expectedHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(amount, salt));
    require(stakingCommitments[msg.sender] == expectedHash, "Invalid hash");
    require(block.timestamp <= commitmentExpiry[msg.sender], "Expired");

    delete stakingCommitments[msg.sender];
    delete commitmentExpiry[msg.sender];

    _stake(amount, msg.sender, false);
}
```
**2. Add a cooldown period between consecutive stake/unstake actions from the same address.**
```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public lastStakeTime;
uint256 public stakeCooldown = 1 minutes;

function stake(uint256 amount) external {
    require(block.timestamp > lastStakeTime[msg.sender] + stakeCooldown, "Cooldown active");
    ...
    lastStakeTime[msg.sender] = block.timestamp;
}
```
