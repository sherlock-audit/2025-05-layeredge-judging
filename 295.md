# [H-02] Unbounded Gas Consumption and Transfer Inconsistencies from Fee-On-Transfer or Callback Tokens

### Summary

The contract performs token transfers using raw IERC20.transfer() and transferFrom() without handling non-standard behaviors. If the staking or reward token implements fee-on-transfer, reentrancy callbacks, or excessive internal logic, this can cause gas exhaustion (OOG), inaccurate reward accounting, or denial-of-service for other users.



### Root Cause

The contract directly uses transfer() and transferFrom() in [Line 301](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L301) and [Line 769](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L769) without wrapping them in OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 or validating the actual transferred amount. This exposes the logic to edge cases in token implementations that don’t conform to the ERC20 standard.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract accepts ERC20 tokens without validating their behavior.
2. Transfers are executed via raw transfer and transferFrom.
3. No checks exist for actual received/returned amounts or gas consumption.

### External Pre-conditions

1. An attacker can deploy or introduce a non-compliant ERC20 token (e.g., fee-on-transfer, ERC777 with tokensToSend() hooks, or gas-draining fallback logic).
2. The attacker or user supplies such a token as either stakingToken or rewardToken.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker sets up a malicious ERC20 token where transfer() consumes excessive gas via a loop or hook.
2. The token is whitelisted or accepted as the staking or reward token.
3. A victim user interacts with stake(), claimReward(), or compound().
4. The function performs a raw token transfer using transfer() or transferFrom().
5. The gas cost exceeds the block limit or fails mid-execution.
6. User funds become inaccessible or the entire function becomes unusable.

### Impact

1. DoS (Denial of Service): Prevents other users from staking, compounding, or claiming rewards if the token logic is gas-intensive.
2. Silent Slippage: In fee-on-transfer tokens, the user may receive less than expected without any notification.
3. Gas Griefing: Increases gas usage drastically, causing legitimate transactions to fail or become uneconomical.

### PoC

```solidity
contract MaliciousToken is IERC20 {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) public returns (bool) {
        // Intentional gas griefing
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
            // No-op to burn gas
        }
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balances[recipient] += amount;
        return true;
    }

    // Stub other ERC20 methods as needed...
}
```
**Scenerio:**

1. The MaliciousToken contract overrides transfer() to include an expensive for loop.
2. When this token is used in LayerEdgeStaking.stake(), the internal transferFrom() call will invoke transfer() on the token.
3. The loop consumes so much gas that the staking call either:
- Runs out of gas and reverts, or
- Makes the operation prohibitively expensive to execute.
4. This effectively griefs the user and breaks the staking flow for anyone using the malicious token — even without exploiting logic vulnerabilities.

### Mitigation

Replace all raw transfer() and transferFrom() calls with SafeERC20.safeTransfer() and safeTransferFrom() from OpenZeppelin. This wrapper:
- Checks for return values properly
- Ensures compatibility with non-standard tokens
- Reverts cleanly on failure
- Prevents execution if the token returns false or fails silently

**Example fix:**
```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol";

using SafeERC20 for IERC20;

stakingToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
stakingToken.safeTransfer(userAddr, request.amount);
```
