# Use of `transfer` instead of `call`

**Description:** 

Based on the `withdraw` function in the weth9 contract, the use of `transfer` instead of `call` for sending Ether presents a potential vulnerability. The `transfer` method fowards a fixed stipend of 2300 gas to the recipient. If the recipient is a contract with a fallback or receive function that requires more than 2300 gas, the transfer will fail, causing the entire tx to revert. This behaviour can lead to a DOS for users whose wallets are contracts with such requirements.

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 wad) public {
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= wad);
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= wad;
@>        payable(msg.sender).transfer(wad);
        emit Withdrawal(msg.sender, wad);
    }
```

**Impact:** 

`Users` with contracts as wallets that require more than 2300 gas to process incoming Ether will be unable to withdraw their funds, leading to a denial of service. This issue can affect a subset of `users`, particularly those using smart contract wallets with complex logic in their fallback or receive functions.

**Proof of Concept:**

* A `user` deploys a smart contract wallet with a fallback function that consumes more than 2300 gas.
* The `user` deposits Ether into the WETH9 contract.
* When the `user` attempts to withdraw their Ether using the withdraw function, the `transfer call` fails due to the gas stipend limitation, causing the transaction to revert.

**Recommended Mitigation:** 

Replace the `transfer` method with the low-level `call` function, which allows forwarding all available gas and handles failures gracefully.
