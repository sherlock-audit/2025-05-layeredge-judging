# The `staker` that has too much interest can't `claim`/`compound` his interest

### Summary

`LayerEdgeStaking` used `rewardsReserve` for `claim`/`compound` interest but if it is not enough, `staker` can't get interest.

### Root Cause

In `LayerEdgetStaking.sol:222`, `LayerEdgetStaking.sol:788`, contract checks `rewardsReserve` is greater than `claimable`(user's whole interest) but if it is not enough, it always reverts.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L788

```solidity
require(rewardsReserve >= claimable, "Insufficient rewards in contract");
```

If `staker` didn't `claim`/`compound` his interest for a long time so `interest` is too much, he can't claim his interest because he must get whole interest at once.

This means `staker` that have much `interest` can't get his interest.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `Staker` have staked huge amount.
2. `Staker` didn't get his `interest` for a long time.

`Staker` has too mush interest.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. `staker` stakes huge amount.
2. `staker` doesn't claim his interest for a long time to get much interest at once.

`staker` can't get his interest. Contract always reverts.

### Impact

`staker` that has too much interest, he can't get his `interest` because he must get interest at once.

### PoC

```solidity
function test_LayerEdgeStaking_InsufficientRewardsForClaiming() public {
        // Alice stakes
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE);
        staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Advance time to accrue rewards
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 30 days);

        // Get pending rewards
        (,,, uint256 pendingRewards) = staking.getUserInfo(alice);
        assertTrue(pendingRewards > 0, "Should have pending rewards");

        // Admin withdraws all rewards, leaving insufficient balance
        vm.startPrank(admin);
        staking.withdrawRewards(staking.rewardsReserve());
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Alice tries to claim but should fail
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        vm.expectRevert("Insufficient rewards in contract");
        staking.claimInterest();
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Alice tries to compound but should fail
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        vm.expectRevert("Insufficient rewards in contract");
        staking.compoundInterest();
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

Because of this, `staker` can't receive any interest when his interest amount is too much.

### Mitigation

Make method that has parameter for amount of interest to claim/compound.
`claimInterest(uint256 amount)`
`compoundInterest(uint256 amount)`
