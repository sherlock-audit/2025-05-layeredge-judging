# Zero-balance users are never cleaned up, causing tree bloat and inaccurate user count

### Summary

The lack of cleanup logic for users with zero balances will cause long-term tree pollution and staker count inaccuracy, especially when many users stake temporarily or drop below minStakeAmount.

### Root Cause

In [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#690](https://github.com/zaid261-spec/2025-05-layeredge-zaid261-spec/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L690), users are removed from the Fenwick Tree when their balance drops below minStakeAmount. However, if their balance drops to exactly zero, their UserInfo entry remains indefinitely. There's no function to purge or reset inactive users.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User unstakes completely or earns 0 balance through claims
2. They are no longer active but remain in storage

### External Pre-conditions

None — long-term blockchain bloat risk

### Attack Path

1. 100k users each stake 10 tokens
2. All users unstake or are refunded, balance = 0
3. users[], stakerAddress, and joinId mappings retain all records
4. Contract thinks these are still "occupied" joinIds

### Impact

1. Long-term bloat in storage and iteration
2. Blockers to MAX_USERS scaling
3. Overhead when computing tree-based ranks or handling historical data

### PoC

// Stake → unstake everything → check users[user].isActive
// Still true, and joinId not freed


### Mitigation

Add a cleanup function to remove users from users[] mapping and release their joinId when their balance is zero and they have no active unstake requests.
