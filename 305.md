# `rewardsReserve` balance not taken into account during unstaking

### Summary

`rewardsReserve` balance not taken into account during unstaking

### Root Cause

Users can stake using either the staking token or native eth, as well as unstake choosing which type arbitrarily. E.g. if Alice stakes with native she is then later allowed to unstake using the staking token.

But during unstaking, there is [no check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L729) made to ensure users unstake only `deposits - rewardsResrve`, instead it's only enforced that their `user.balance` covers the amount:

```solidity
    function _unstake(uint256 amount, address userAddr) internal {
        UserInfo storage user = users[userAddr];

        // require(user.isActive, "No active stake");
>>      require(user.balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        // Update interest before changing balance
        _updateInterest(userAddr);

        // Update user balances
        user.balance -= amount;
        user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;

        // Update total staked
        totalStaked -= amount;

        if (!user.outOfTree && user.balance < minStakeAmount) {
            // execute this before removing from tree, this will make sure to calculate interest
            //for amount left after unstake
            _recordTierChange(userAddr, Tier.Tier3);
            stakerTree.update(user.joinId, -1);
            stakerCountInTree--;
            user.outOfTree = true;
            stakerCountOutOfTree++;
            _checkBoundariesAndRecord(true);
        }

        // Add unstake request instead of immediate transfer
        unstakeRequests[userAddr].push(UnstakeRequest({amount: amount, timestamp: block.timestamp, completed: false}));
    }
```

This becomes an issue since rewards are only deposited in the staking token, but stakes can be made in native eth:

```solidity
    function stakeNative() external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        _stake(msg.value, msg.sender, true);
    }

    function depositRewards(uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        require(amount > 0, "Cannot deposit zero amount");

        // Update rewards reserve
        rewardsReserve += amount;

        // Transfer tokens from sender to contract
>>      require(stakingToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount), "Token transfer failed");
    }
```

Example:

1. 5 users stake using native
2. Rewards are deposited
3. Some of the users unstake using the staking token which will pay them out tokens from the `rewardsReserve` since only eth was deposited, and there is nowhere else from where the tokens could have come
4. Users now try to claim rewards which will revert when attempting to transfer out the staking token:

```solidity
    function _claimInterest(address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
        ...
        if (!isNative) {
            require(stakingToken.transfer(userAddr, claimable), "Token transfer failed");
        } else {
            IWETH(address(stakingToken)).withdraw(claimable);
            (bool success,) = payable(userAddr).call{value: claimable}("");
            require(success, "Claim interest native transfer failed");
        }

        emit RewardClaimed(userAddr, claimable);
    }
```

Since the `stakingToken` on mainnet will not be a fork of WETH but a normal ERC20 token, it won't be possible to wrap and use the `IWETH` interface for the staking token and the rewards must be claimed in staking tokens.

This breaks an invariant where the contract's staking token balance falls below the `rewardsReserve` outside of claiming rewards, even though only rewards were deposited in that token type.

### Impact

This breaks an invariant where the contract's staking token balance falls below the `rewardsReserve` outside of claiming rewards, even though only rewards were deposited in that token type and only with intent to pay out "rewards".
