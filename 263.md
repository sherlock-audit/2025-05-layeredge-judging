# Current contract will not work on mainnet

### Summary

Current contract will not work on mainnet

### Root Cause

The protocol plans to deploy both on LayerEdge L1 and mainnet. The current staking contract used will only be compatible with LayerEdge L1.

This is due to the fact that on mainnet the staking token will be an ERC20 EDGEN token, whilst on the layer edge L1 it will be a fork of WETH9. The current implementation only accounts for the second case, which is evident from many of the functions. Let's examine [staking with native](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L683-L687):

```solidity
    function _stake(uint256 amount, address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
        ...
        // Transfer tokens from user to contract
        if (!isNative) {
            require(stakingToken.transferFrom(userAddr, address(this), amount), "Token transfer failed");
        } else {
>>          IWETH(address(stakingToken)).deposit{value: amount}();
        }
        ...
    }
```

The `IWETH` wrapper is hardcoded to the `stakingToken` address which will be the ERC-20 EDGEN token. Since that token will only be a fork of WETH on LayerEdge L1, here the calls will simply revert. Due to this, the contract is currently not compatible with staking native eth on mainnet.
