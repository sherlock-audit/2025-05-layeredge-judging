# User Staking Blocked After Initial Stake Below Minimum Amount

### Summary

The staking contract sets `user.isActive = true` when a user stakes for the first time with an amount less than the `minStakeAmount`. This causes the subsequent staking logic that requires `!user.isActive` to never execute again for that user. As a result, if the user tries to stake again with an amount above the minimum, the contract does not properly update their status or tier because it assumes the user is already active but does not handle upgrading from the `“out-of-tree”` tier.

This effectively blocks users who initially staked below the minimum amount from staking again with higher amounts, preventing them from moving into the main staking tree or receiving the correct tier assignment.

### Root Cause

 ```solidity
function _stake(uint256 amount, address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

        //Staking for first time and amount is less than minStakeAmount, user will be in tier 3 permanently and out of the tree
@>    if (!user.isActive && amount < minStakeAmount) {
            stakerCountOutOfTree++;
@>      user.isActive = true;
            user.outOfTree = true;
            _recordTierChange(userAddr, tier);
        }

        // If first time staking, register staker position whose stake is more than minStakeAmount
@>     if (!user.isActive && amount >= minStakeAmount) {
            user.joinId = nextJoinId++;
            stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1);
            stakerAddress[user.joinId] = userAddr;
            user.isActive = true;
            stakerCountInTree++;

            uint256 rank = stakerTree.query(user.joinId);
            tier = _computeTierByRank(rank, stakerCountInTree);
            user.isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake = true;

            _recordTierChange(userAddr, tier);
            _checkBoundariesAndRecord(false);
        }

     ,,,,,,,,,,,,
    }
```

### Attack Path

1. Initial Stake Below Minimum:
A user stakes an amount less than the required `minStakeAmount` for the first time. This sets `user.isActive` = true and `user.outOfTree` = true.

2. User Attempts to Stake Again with Higher Amount:
The user tries to increase their stake by depositing an amount greater than or equal to `minStakeAmount`.

3. Staking Logic Blocks the Upgrade:
Because `user.isActive` is already true, the contract skips the logic to add the user to the staking tree and to update their tier accordingly.

4. Result:
The user's stake balance increases, but they remain “out of the staking tree” (`outOfTree = true`), never assigned to a proper tier, and without access to staking benefits (e.g., rewards or tier-specific privileges).

5. Impact:
The user is effectively locked out from participating fully in the staking system despite increasing their stake above the minimum required threshold.

### Impact

1.Potential Financial Loss: Users might unknowingly lose staking rewards or incentives since their stakes are not properly recognized in the system.

2. Reduced Protocol Utility: The protocol loses potential locked value and engagement from users prevented from upgrading their stake.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the _stake logic to allow users who initially staked below minStakeAmount to restake and move them into the staking tree (outOfTree = false, isActive = true) once their total stake meets or exceeds the minimum.

This will enable multiple stakes and proper tier assignment without locking users out.
