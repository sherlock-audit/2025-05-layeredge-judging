# Incorrect UUPS Upgrade Mechanism Leads To Failed Upgrades

### Summary

The [LayerEdgenStaking](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L129-L134?plain=1) contract, intended to be upgradeable using the UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) pattern, has an incorrect implementation that will prevent future upgrades. Specifically, the `__UUPSUpgradeable_init()` function is missing from the `initialize()` function, and the `upgradeToAndCall()` function, which is critical for performing upgrades, is not properly implemented. This omission means that the contract's proxy will always point to the original implementation, rendering it un-upgradeable.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue is the incomplete implementation of the UUPS upgrade pattern within the `LayerEdgenStaking.sol` contract. While the contract attempts to utilize OpenZeppelin's UUPSUpgradeable library, it fails to correctly set up the upgrade mechanism.

1. Missing `__UUPSUpgradeable_init()` in [initialize()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L129-L134?plain=1): The `__UUPSUpgradeable_init()` function is crucial for initializing the UUPS upgradeability logic, including setting the upgradeable admin role. Without this call during the initial deployment and initialization of the proxy, the upgrade mechanism is not properly configured. The provided code snippet shows `__UUPSUpgradeable_init()` is commented out or missing.

```solidity
function initialize(address _stakingToken, address _admin) public initializer {
        require(_stakingToken != address(0), "Invalid token address");
        stakingToken = IERC20(_stakingToken);

        // CORRECT INITIALIZATION ORDER
        __Ownable_init(_admin);         // Sets the general contract owner
//@>    __UUPSUpgradeable_init();       // Initialize UUPS upgradeability (relies on owner from Ownable)
        __Pausable_init();
        __ReentrancyGuard_init();

        // ... rest of your initialization ...
    }
```
2. Missing `upgradeToAndCall()` implementation: The `_authorizeUpgrade()` function only checks permissions for an upgrade but does not execute it. The actual upgrade process for UUPS proxies requires a call to the `upgradeToAndCall()` function on the proxy itself, which then delegates to the implementation's upgradeToAndCall to perform the upgrade and execute any post-upgrade logic. Without this function being correctly overridden or explicitly called, there's no mechanism to trigger the upgrade.
```solidity
// _authorizeUpgrade only checks permissions, and the upgrade requires a separate upgradeToAndCall call on the proxy.
function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation) internal override onlyOwner {}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The LayerEdgenStaking contract is deployed as an upgradeable proxy using the UUPS pattern.
- The initialize() function has been called on the proxy.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

This issue isn't about an attacker stealing funds directly. Instead, it's a critical flaw that prevents the contract from ever being updated.

1. Deployment Flaw: The `LayerEdgenStaking` contract is deployed, but its initial setup (the `initialize()` function) is missing a crucial step: calling `__UUPSUpgradeable_init()`. This means the contract isn't properly "primed" for future upgrades.
2. No Upgrade Mechanism: Even if the contract's owner tries to upgrade it later, there's no working mechanism to do so. The necessary `upgradeToAndCall()` function is either missing or incorrectly implemented.
3. Stuck in Time: As a result, the contract's code can never be changed or fixed. If a bug is found, a security vulnerability surfaces, or new features are needed, the contract is permanently stuck with its original, potentially flawed, version.

### Impact

- Permanent Vulnerabilities: If a critical security vulnerability is discovered in the deployed contract, it cannot be patched, leaving user funds or the protocol's integrity at risk.
- Loss of Features: New functionalities or improvements cannot be introduced, hindering the project's evolution and competitiveness.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement `__UUPSUpgradeable_init()` in `initialize()` and `upgradeToAndCall()`.
```diff
function initialize(address _stakingToken, address _admin) public initializer {
        require(_stakingToken != address(0), "Invalid token address");
        stakingToken = IERC20(_stakingToken);

        // CORRECT INITIALIZATION ORDER
        __Ownable_init(_admin);         // Sets the general contract owner
+       __UUPSUpgradeable_init();       // Initialize UUPS upgradeability (relies on owner from Ownable)
        __Pausable_init();
        __ReentrancyGuard_init();

        // ... rest of your initialization ...
    }

+ function upgradeToAndCall(address newImplementation, bytes memory data)   
+    public   
+    payable   
+    override
+    onlyOwner
+  {  
+    // Custom pre-upgrade logic here  
+    require(!paused(), "Cannot upgrade while paused");  
+      
+    // Call the parent implementation  
+    super.upgradeToAndCall(newImplementation, data);  
+      
+    // Custom post-upgrade logic here  
+ }
```
