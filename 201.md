### Title:
LayerEdgeStaking::withdrawRewards reduces rewardsReserve before confirming token transfer (Logic mismatch)

# Description

The LayerEdgeStaking::withdrawRewards function subtracts the amount from rewardsReserve before checking if the token transfer to the owner was successful. If the transfer fails, the internal rewards tracking will still be reduced, even though no tokens were actually sent. This creates a mismatch between what the contract thinks it has and what it really has.

Here is the function:

```solidity
function withdrawRewards(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    require(amount > 0, "Cannot withdraw zero amount");
    require(amount <= rewardsReserve, "Insufficient rewards");

    rewardsReserve -= amount;

    // Transfer tokens to admin
    require(stakingToken.transfer(owner(), amount), "Token transfer failed");
}
```

###Impact

If the transfer fails, the contract reduces rewardsReserve anyway. This can cause rewardsReserve to go out of sync with the actual token balance in the contract. That means future  withdrawals could fail or be incorrect. This breaks the accuracy of reward tracking and can make users think there are fewer rewards than whatâ€™s really available.

#Proof of Concepts

1. Owner calls withdrawRewards(1000)


2. rewardsReserve -= 1000 runs


3. transfer() fails (for example, the token has a transfer() bug, or there is not enough balance)


4. rewardsReserve is now 1000 lower, even though no tokens left the contract


5. The number is now wrong and can break reward logic for users

# Recommended mitigation

Move the rewardsReserve -= amount; line after the token transfer is confirmed. Like this:
```solidity
require(stakingToken.transfer(owner(), amount), "Token transfer failed");
rewardsReserve -= amount;
```

This way, the contract only updates its internal tracking if the transfer really happened.
