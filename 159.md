# Same minimum stake threshold for native and ERC20 tokens with different values leads to unfair tier assignment

### Summary

The `LayerEdgeStaking` contract applies the same `minStakeAmount` threshold for both native token staking and ERC20 token staking, despite the significant value differences between these tokens. On Ethereum, the staking token (EDGEN) is an OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation that is not designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with ETH, while on LayerEdge, the staking token is WETH9 which maintains 1:1 parity with the native token.

This design flaw creates an unfair advantage on the ETH chain where users can achieve the same tier status by staking tokens of vastly different economic values. The same numerical threshold is applied regardless of the underlying token's market value, leading to inequitable tier assignments.

Furthermore, the `minStakeAmount` is set to 3000 tokens on the Ethereum chain. This configuration clearly indicates that the staking token is not intended to be pegged 1:1 with the native token, as 3000 ETH currently represents approximately $7,673,013 USD - an unreasonably high minimum stake amount that suggests EDGEN tokens are expected to have a much lower individual value than ETH.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue is that the `LayerEdgeStaking` contract does not implement a different minimum stake amount for native and ERC20 tokens. This means that users can achieve the same tier status by staking tokens of vastly different economic values. The same numerical threshold is applied regardless of the underlying token's market value, leading to inequitable tier assignments.

### Impact

The impact of this issue is that users can achieve the same tier status by staking tokens of vastly different economic values. The same numerical threshold is applied regardless of the underlying token's market value, leading to inequitable tier assignments.

### PoC

1. Assume EDGEN token is worth 0.5 ETH per token and `minStakeAmount` is set to 3000 tokens
2. User A calls `LayerEdgeStaking::stakeNative` with 3000 ETH (worth 3000 ETH)
3. User B calls `LayerEdgeStaking::stake` with 3000 EDGEN tokens (worth 1500 ETH equivalent)
4. Both users pass the `minStakeAmount` check and enter the staking tree with tier eligibility
5. User A has put up twice the actual value but receives the same tier treatment as User B

```solidity
// LayerEdgeStaking.sol
function _stake(uint256 amount, address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
    // ...
    // Same minStakeAmount threshold applied regardless of token type
    if (!user.isActive && amount < minStakeAmount) {
        stakerCountOutOfTree++;
        user.isActive = true;
        user.outOfTree = true;
        _recordTierChange(userAddr, tier);
    }
    
    if (!user.isActive && amount >= minStakeAmount) {
        // User enters staking tree and becomes tier-eligible
        user.joinId = nextJoinId++;
        stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1);
        // ...
    }
}
```

The same issue exists in `LayerEdgeStaking::_unstake` where users are moved out of the tree when their remaining balance falls below `minStakeAmount`, without considering token value differences.

### Mitigation

Separate minimum stake amounts
```diff
- uint256 public minStakeAmount;
+ uint256 public minStakeAmountNative;
+ uint256 public minStakeAmountToken;

function _stake(uint256 amount, address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
+   uint256 threshold = isNative ? minStakeAmountNative : minStakeAmountToken;
-   if (!user.isActive && amount < minStakeAmount) {
+   if (!user.isActive && amount < threshold) {
```
