# Unclear Deployment Targets

### Summary

The repo’s docs list “Ethereum Mainnet” and “LayerEdge L1” as deployment chains, but don’t pin specific network IDs.

### Root Cause

Lack of explicit chain constants or comments in the deployment scripts.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Scripts assume chainId is passed correctly from the front end.

### External Pre-conditions

User must supply the correct RPC endpoints for each chain.

### Attack Path

A misconfigured or malicious RPC provider could steer deployments to an unintended network.

### Impact

Low–medium: could cause contracts to be published on the wrong chain, leading to lost funds or unmet expectations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Hard-code or document exact chainIds and recommended RPC URLs.
 Add a sanity check in deployment scripts: require(chainId == 1 || chainId == X, “Wrong network”).
