# Rewards Miscalculation Due to Balance History Ignorance

### Summary

The use of current balance for all time intervals will cause inaccurate interest rewards for users as any user who changes balance during staking will receive incorrect interest due to non-historical accounting.

### Root Cause

The use of current balance for all time intervals will cause inaccurate interest rewards for users as any user who changes balance during staking will receive incorrect interest due to non-historical accounting.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A user must change their balance during staking (e.g., unstake or stake more).

Interest must be calculated across multiple historical APY periods.

### External Pre-conditions

.

### Attack Path

A user stakes 1 ETH and leaves it for 30 days.

On Day 31, they stake 10 ETH more (now have 11 ETH).

On Day 32, interest is calculated using 11 ETH for all 31 days.

Rewards are overpaid for the 30-day period where only 1 ETH was staked.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a financial loss as users are overpaid interest. Inversely, some users may be underpaid, leading to unfair distribution of rewards.

### PoC

```solidity
// Test scenario: Balance increase during staking period
function testInterestOverpayment() public {
    // Setup: User stakes 1000 tokens (Tier 1)
    vm.prank(user);
    staking.stake(1000);

    // Wait 30 days
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 30 days);

    // Compound interest (balance becomes 1050)
    vm.prank(user);
    staking.compoundInterest();

    // Calculate unclaimed interest (should use historical balance)
    uint256 interest = staking.calculateUnclaimedInterest(user);

    // Incorrect: Uses current balance (1050) for all periods
    // Correct: Should use 1000 for first 30 days, then 1050 afterward
    assertGt(interest, EXPECTED_CORRECT_INTEREST); // Fails due to overpayment
}

```

### Mitigation

Track historical balances per user using timestamped snapshots:
```solidity
struct BalanceSnapshot {
    uint256 balance;
    uint256 timestamp;
}
mapping(address => BalanceSnapshot[]) public userBalanceHistory;

// Update balance history on every stake/unstake/compound:
function _updateBalanceHistory(address userAddr) internal {
    userBalanceHistory[userAddr].push(BalanceSnapshot({
        balance: users[userAddr].balance,
        timestamp: block.timestamp
    }));
}

// Use historical balances in calculateUnclaimedInterest:
uint256 currentPeriodBalance = getBalanceAtTime(userAddr, periodStart);
uint256 periodInterest = (currentPeriodBalance * apy * duration) / (SECONDS_IN_YEAR * PRECISION * 100);
```
Use these snapshots to compute interest per period instead of using the current balance.
