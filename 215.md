# Interest leak via tier-flip rounding erosion

### Summary

Every time a user’s tier changes, the contract 
(1) computes a weighted average APY by `weightedSum / totalDuration` and 
(2) calculates each sub-period’s interest with an integer division by (`SECONDS_IN_YEAR * PRECISION`) and then by 100. 

Both divisions truncate downward, so users who flip tiers frequently lose a few wei each interval—add up enough flips (e.g. block-by-block compounders) and those tiny losses become whole tokens

### Root Cause

Double integer truncation in [getTierAPYForPeriod](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L527-L586)

```solidity
weightedSum += period.rate * duration;
…
return weightedSum / totalDuration;
```

floors the weighted average APY to the nearest integer

In `calculateUnclaimedInterest`, each sub-period’s interest is computed as

```solidity
uint256 periodInterest =
  ((user.balance * apy * (periodEnd - periodStart))
    / (SECONDS_IN_YEAR * PRECISION)) / 100;
```
which floors again, losing fractional wei per sub-period

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The user’s `stakerTierHistory` contains multiple events, so `calculateUnclaimedInterest` loops over several sub-periods.
- Each loop iteration executes two integer divisions on non-zero balances.

### External Pre-conditions

- A user compounds or claims interest across tier boundaries, e.g. by frequently topping up or withdrawing just around the tier thresholds.
- An arbitrage bot compounds every block, forcing a tier flip on each block.

### Attack Path
1. Alice stakes exactly 1,000 TOK (the Tier 1→Tier 2 cutoff) on Day 1.
2. She calls `compoundInterest()`. Since she stayed within Tier 1, the code does one truncating division, dropping any fractional wei once 
3. Immediately after, she stakes +1 wei, pushing her into Tier 2 (7% APY).
4. Compounding one block later splits that block into two sub-periods. First, the weighted APY itself was floored by `return weightedSum / totalDuration;` losing any fractional APY . Then each sub-period’s interest runs the same two-step truncation above—so Alice loses tiny fractions twice
5. If she (or a bot) repeats “stake +1 wei → compound” every block, those ε-wei losses pile up into whole tokens over thousands of flips.

### Impact

- **Slow “interest leak”:** Honest stakers (or bots) lose tiny amounts of yield on every tier flip—potentially whole tokens over time.
- **Breaks core functionality:** The contract no longer delivers the exact APY it advertises, undermining trust and fairness.

Under Sherlock’s Medium severity criteria 
>“breaks core contract functionality” and losses “> 0.01 % and > $10” qualify as Medium 

this bug should be classified as Medium severity.
