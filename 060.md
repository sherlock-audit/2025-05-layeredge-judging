# New users can bypass minimum stake protection due to missing amount check in stake()

### Summary

The lack of a minimum stake check in stake() will cause inconsistent tier assignments for new users as the contract skips minStakeAmount enforcement under certain staking flows.

### Root Cause

In [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#610](https://github.com/zaid261-spec/2025-05-layeredge-zaid261-spec/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L610), the _stake() function accepts any amount greater than zero and only checks for minStakeAmount if user.isActive == false. There is no strict enforcement to reject users staking below minStakeAmount, which causes tree pollution and tier misalignment.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User does not yet exist in users[]
2. They call stake() with an amount less than minStakeAmount (e.g. 100 tokens)

### External Pre-conditions

None — this is an on-chain-only state logic issue.

### Attack Path

1. User stakes 100 tokens (below minimum) — no rejection occurs
2. Their account is created and stored in users
3. Later they stake more, and are assigned a joinId without a clean tier reassessment
4. This user’s placement causes improper reward distribution calculations

### Impact

Users may receive higher APYs than allowed for their true stake weight, and the Fenwick tree may store skewed rank data. This degrades reward fairness and accurate tiering.

### PoC

// Call stake() with 100 tokens (below min threshold) from new address
// No revert, and user is initialized


### Mitigation

Enforce require(amount >= minStakeAmount) inside stake() for all first-time stakers, not just conditionally.
