# Permanent Tier Demotion Without Re-entry Mechanism

### Summary

In _stake(), the lack of re-entry logic for outOfTree users causes [unfair exclusion] for [stakers] as [users who temporarily fall below minStakeAmount] will [permanently lose tier eligibility].

### Root Cause

In LayerEdgeStaking.sol:_stake(), there is no check to reinsert outOfTree users into the Fenwick tree when their new balance meets or exceeds minStakeAmount.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A user needs to fully or partially unstake to reduce their balance below minStakeAmount, setting outOfTree = true.

The same user later stakes again, increasing balance >= minStakeAmount.

### External Pre-conditions

.

### Attack Path

A user stakes an amount ≥ minStakeAmount and gets added to the tree.

The user unstakes, dropping below minStakeAmount → marked outOfTree.

The user restakes enough to go above minStakeAmount.

Due to missing logic, the user remains outOfTree and excluded from tier calculations.

### Impact

The user suffers an indefinite loss of rewards from higher tiers. The protocol loses correctness in tier distribution, violating the FCFS invariant.

### PoC

```solidity
// After unstake
require(user.outOfTree == true);

// After restake with sufficient amount
require(user.balance >= minStakeAmount);
require(user.outOfTree == true); // still true, no reinsertion logic
```

### Mitigation

Add a conditional reinsertion in _stake():
```solidity
if (user.outOfTree && (user.balance + amount) >= minStakeAmount) {
    user.outOfTree = false;
    stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1);
    stakerCountInTree++;
    stakerCountOutOfTree--;
    _checkBoundariesAndRecord(false);
}

```
