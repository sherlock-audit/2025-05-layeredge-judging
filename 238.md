# If an admin changes the APY for Tier.None, then they actually change the APY for Tier 3

### Summary

Suppose the admin calls `updateTierApy(Tier.None, 0)`. You might think this means "Oh, if there are any users who are somehow in the system but not at any tier, then it makes sure they receive no interest."

What this actually does is remove all interest from users at Tier 3. Bad.

And that's it.

Any time there is an issue which requires the admin to do something, one can argue "Invalid! Admin error." I do not believe that is accurate: it is not admin error to do a function call which should be harmless but isn't. So I do not believe that rule applies.

Instead I believe ithis is a Valid Low, which I am submitting just in case someone else judges it to be Medium.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L248-L264

We can see that the else branch here runs when the input tier is Tier.None

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Admin calls updateTierAPI(Tier.None, 0), thinking that there are some users  at Tier.None this would apply to.
2. Wait some time
3. Tier 3 users suddenly notice they're not getting the interest they're owed.

### Impact

If the admin calls updateTierApy(Tier.None, something), then they are unknowingly changing the APY for Tier 3. If an admin does call updateTierApy(Tier.None, something), then most likely something=0 (what other rate would you give to users of Tier.None), meaning Tier 3 users would be screwed over. 

I consider this to be Low, but am submitting just in case.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove Tier.None. It's never used.
