# Sybil attacker will cause tier mismatch for stakers by overloading the Fenwick Tree boundary logic

### Summary

The aggressive staking and unstaking of multiple accounts will cause inaccurate tier assignments for stakers as a Sybil attacker will exploit _checkBoundariesAndRecord() gas-heavy loops to create desyncs.

### Root Cause

In [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#841](https://github.com/zaid261-spec/2025-05-layeredge-zaid261-spec/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L841), the `_checkBoundariesAndRecord()` function contains unbounded loops that iterate across tier thresholds based on staking events. These loops can become extremely gas-heavy and fail mid-execution under Sybil conditions or during batch stake/unstake events.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A Sybil attacker needs to stake with many wallets (e.g. 1000+) to manipulate tier boundaries.
2. Multiple stake/unstake operations must occur in a short timeframe to trigger _checkBoundariesAndRecord().

### External Pre-conditions

1. Block gas limits must allow transaction inclusion (e.g. via bundlers/flashbots).
2. Network must allow high-throughput operations.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker funds 1000 wallets, all stake just above minStakeAmount.
2. All wallets stake sequentially to trigger _checkBoundariesAndRecord().
3. Attacker unstake-spams same wallets, triggering large for loops again.
4. Some tier boundary recalculations fail mid-iteration, leading to outdated or skipped tier events for others.

### Impact

The protocol suffers logic desync where stakers are assigned incorrect tiers. The attacker loses gas but could delay or degrade staking reward accuracy for others. This can also result in reward miscalculations.

### PoC

Can be simulated in Foundry with 500+ fake stakers.

### Mitigation

Limit the number of for loop iterations in _checkBoundariesAndRecord() and batch deferred tier updates off-chain or in paginated admin calls.
