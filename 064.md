# Users stop earning rewards prematurely during 7-day unstake window

### Summary

The 7-day unstake queue causes a user’s balance to stop earning rewards and APY immediately, which unfairly penalizes users for unstaking early, even while funds are still locked in the contract.

### Root Cause

In [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#777](https://github.com/zaid261-spec/2025-05-layeredge-zaid261-spec/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L777), the _unstake() function decreases the user's balance and updates tier status before adding the amount to the unstakeRequests[] queue. However, the tokens are still locked and controlled by the protocol for 7 more days — but they stop earning rewards instantly.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User has a balance slightly above minStakeAmount
2. They call unstake() and trigger Tier 3 downgrade

### External Pre-conditions

None — this is a logic fairness issue

### Attack Path

1. User stakes 5000 tokens and stays in Tier 2
2. They call unstake(4000)
3. Their balance is lowered and they drop to Tier 3 immediately
4. Over the 7-day unstake window, they earn nothing — even though protocol still holds their tokens

### Impact

Users are underpaid by several days' worth of APY due to premature exclusion. This creates an invisible earnings gap, especially for large unstakers who expect full returns until the actual transfer.

### PoC

// Stake → Unstake → Wait 7 days → Compare expected vs. actual interest


### Mitigation

Maintain a shadow balance during the unstake lock period and include it in APY calculation, or delay tier downgrade until completeUnstake() is executed.
