# [High] `LayerEdgeStaking::_stake()` over-credits user balance when using fee-on-transfer tokens

### Summary

The assumption in `LayerEdgeStaking::_stake()` that `stakingToken.transferFrom()` delivers the full requested amount will cause reward inflation and accounting corruption for the protocol, as any user staking fee-on-transfer tokens will be credited with more tokens than were actually received.

### Root Cause

In [`LayerEdgeStaking.sol:684`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L684), the contract performs accounting using the input `amount`, rather than measuring the actual number of tokens received by the contract.

```solidity
    function _stake(uint256 amount, address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
        require(amount > 0, "Cannot stake zero amount");

        UserInfo storage user = users[userAddr];

        // Update interest before changing balance
        _updateInterest(userAddr);

        // Transfer tokens from user to contract
        if (!isNative) {
@>          require(stakingToken.transferFrom(userAddr, address(this), amount), "Token transfer failed");
        } else {
            IWETH(address(stakingToken)).deposit{value: amount}();
        }

        Tier tier = Tier.Tier3;

        //Staking for first time and amount is less than minStakeAmount, user will be in tier 3 permanently and out of the tree
        if (!user.isActive && amount < minStakeAmount) {
            stakerCountOutOfTree++;
            user.isActive = true;
            user.outOfTree = true;
            _recordTierChange(userAddr, tier);
        }

        // If first time staking, register staker position whose stake is more than minStakeAmount
        if (!user.isActive && amount >= minStakeAmount) {
            user.joinId = nextJoinId++;
            stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1);
            stakerAddress[user.joinId] = userAddr;
            user.isActive = true;
            stakerCountInTree++;

            uint256 rank = stakerTree.query(user.joinId);
            tier = _computeTierByRank(rank, stakerCountInTree);
            user.isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake = true;

            _recordTierChange(userAddr, tier);
            _checkBoundariesAndRecord(false);
        }

        // Update user balances
@>      user.balance += amount;
        user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;

        // Update total staked
@>      totalStaked += amount;

        emit Staked(userAddr, amount, tier);
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user stakes a token that implements fee-on-transfer logic (e.g., 1% burn).
2. The token’s `transferFrom()` succeeds but only sends a reduced amount.
3. The contract assumes the full amount was received and updates `user.balance` and `totalStaked` using the incorrect input amount.

### External Pre-conditions

None required — this affects any token with fee-on-transfer behavior.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker deploys or uses a deflationary ERC20 with a 1% fee on transfer.
2. Attacker approves and calls `stake(100e18)` with the token.
3. Only 99e18 tokens are received by the contract.
4. Contract credits `user.balance += 100e18` and `totalStaked += 100e18`.
5. Attacker earns interest based on 100e18 despite only contributing 99e18.
6. Over time, the protocol pays out more rewards than it should, and tier thresholds are skewed.

### Impact

Stakers using fee-on-transfer tokens are over-credited and receive inflated rewards.
- `user.balance` and `totalStaked` are corrupted.
- Tier calculations are distorted.
- Honest users receive a smaller share of rewards.

This creates systemic unfairness, long-term accounting divergence, and reward leakage - a clear High severity issue.

```

### Mitigation

In `_stake()`, replace this:
```solidity
require(stakingToken.transferFrom(userAddr, address(this), amount), "Token transfer failed");
user.balance += amount;
totalStaked += amount;
```

With this: 
```solidity
uint256 before = stakingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
require(stakingToken.transferFrom(userAddr, address(this), amount), "Token transfer failed");
uint256 received = stakingToken.balanceOf(address(this)) - before;

user.balance += received;
totalStaked += received;
```

Alternatively, disallow fee-on-transfer tokens entirely via a validation check or external whitelist.
