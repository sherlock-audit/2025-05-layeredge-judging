# `approve()` function in the `WETH9` contract could be frontrun

### Summary

Approved spenders of `WETH9` can frontrun allowance updates, resulting in more funds being spent than expected.

This is a common vulnerability in contracts that use `approve()` and has been accepted as a valid issue in previous contests on Sherlock: https://solodit.cyfrin.io/issues/m-7-approve-and-transferfrom-functions-of-pool-tokens-are-subject-to-front-run-attack-sherlock-none-surge-git

### Root Cause

In order to approve the spending of funds on behalf of someone else users have to use the [WETH9::approve()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/WETH9.sol#L37-L41) function. If there is already an existing approval and the `approve()` function is called again it will overwrite the previous amount. A call to change this allowance could be frontrun by the spender thus spending the initial + the new allowance. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1.Alice approves Bob for 100 WETH
2.Alice submits a `WETH9::approve()` transaction to decrease Bob's allowance to 50 WETH
3.Bob notices Alice's transaction and frontruns it by transferring the initial allowance amount of tokens
4.Bob has spent 100 WETH and now has allowance for 50 more
5.Bob spends the 50 WETH resulting in him spending 150 WETH in total, while the max allowance Alice gave him is 100 WETH

### Impact

Malicious spenders can exploit allowance updates.

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding `increaseAllowance` and `decreaseAllowance` functions.
