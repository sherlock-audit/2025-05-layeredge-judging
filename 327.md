# Reward Deposit Function Lacks Interest Update Mechanism

### Summary

The `depositRewards` function in the LayerEdgeStaking contract does not update user interest before changing the rewards balance. This design flaw means that users who deposit rewards cannot benefit from their own deposits, which disincentivizes users from contributing to the reward pool.

### Root Cause

The `depositRewards` function directly updates the `rewardsReserve` without first calling `_updateInterest` to calculate and store pending interest for all users. This is inconsistent with other functions in the contract that modify balances, such as `stake` and `unstake`, which do update interest before changing balances.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The contract must be in an unpaused state

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. User A has staked tokens and earned interest
2. User B deposits rewards into the contract
3. User A's interest is not updated before the reward deposit
4. User A claims interest, but the calculation does not include the newly deposited rewards
5. The newly deposited rewards are effectively locked until the next interest update

### Impact

- Users who deposit rewards cannot benefit from their own deposits
- The reward deposit function becomes less effective as users have no incentive to contribute
- Reduced protocol efficiency and user participation


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the `depositRewards` function to call `_updateInterest` before changing the rewards balance
