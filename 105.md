# [High] Stakers can grief earlier users by downgrading their tier and erasing earned rewards (LayerEdgeStaking::_checkBoundariesAndRecord)

### Summary

Missing reward checkpointing during tier transitions will cause a loss of earned interest for stakers as unprivileged users will indirectly downgrade others' tiers through new deposits, which retroactively alters reward calculations.

### Root Cause

In [LayerEdgeStaking.sol::_checkBoundariesAndRecord](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L841-L900), the contract updates a user's tier in response to other users staking or unstaking, but does not call `_updateInterest()` for the affected users before changing their tier.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. [User A needs to stake] before any other users to receive Tier 1 APY.
2. [User A needs to accrue rewards] for some time without claiming interest.
3. [User B needs to stake] enough to push User A’s rank into Tier 2.

### External Pre-conditions

None; this attack is purely internal and does not rely on external protocols.

### Attack Path

1. User A (Alice) stakes early and enters Tier 1.
2 . Time passes, and Alice accrues high-APY interest.
3. User B (Bob) stakes after Alice, and the contract updates the Fenwick tree.
4. Alice is demoted to Tier 2 via `_checkBoundariesAndRecord()` without any reward checkpointing.
5. When Alice finally claims, `calculateUnclaimedInterest()` uses her new tier (Tier 2) for the entire time window, resulting in silent loss of Tier 1 rewards.
6. Bob can repeat this for other users by continuously pushing users across tier boundaries.

### Impact

The affected staker (e.g., Alice) suffers an approximate loss of 209.58 tokens in this scenario.
The attacker (Bob) does not gain tokens but can grief other stakers to silently erase their previously earned rewards — potentially undermining the protocol’s economic trust assumptions.

### PoC

This test shows that:
- A user who stakes early earns Tier 1 rewards.
- A second user stakes later, changing tree structure and demoting the original staker to Tier 2.
- When the original staker claims rewards, the contract calculates them entirely based on their final tier (Tier 2), even though they were in Tier 1 for part of the time.

Alice earned 209.59 tokens, but received 0 due to retroactive tier change and lack of reward checkpointing.

### Mitigation

Update `_checkBoundariesAndRecord()` to call `_updateInterest()` on any user whose tier is modified before applying the new tier.

**Recommended Code Fix:**
```solidity
function _findAndRecordTierChange(uint256 rank, uint256 _stakerCountInTree) internal {
    uint256 joinIdCross = stakerTree.findByCumulativeFrequency(rank);
    address userCross = stakerAddress[joinIdCross];

+   _updateInterest(userCross); // Ensure rewards are locked in before tier change

    uint256 _rank = stakerTree.query(joinIdCross);
    Tier toTier = _computeTierByRank(_rank, _stakerCountInTree);
    _recordTierChange(userCross, toTier);
}
```

This ensures the user’s earned rewards are snapshotted before any automatic tier demotion caused by other users’ actions.
