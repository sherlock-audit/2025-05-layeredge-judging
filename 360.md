# Potential out of gas when frequently calling stake and unstake

### Summary

Calling of the function stake and unstake will lead to them paying higher gas and on top of that some users will face out of gas also due to the function call to _checkBoundariesAndRecord due to it changing tiers according to configurations

### Root Cause

the function  _checkBoundariesAndRecord https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L841
is used inside the stake and unstake functions
this function is for maintaining the tier system however this puts stress on the users whose tiers have been changed as the function _findAndRecordTierChange (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L907) calls the function _recordtierchange (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L817)and it adds a new tier to the history This would lead to more calls internally in the function calculateunclaimedinterest for the user whose tier got swapped(changed) which will get called inside the function updateInterest which is being used all over the protocol

### Internal Pre-conditions

people have used the protocols stake function

### External Pre-conditions

normal conditions

### Attack Path

assume there are sufficient stakers inside the tree system 
there are a few ways this edge case can occur 
1) Users frequently stake and unstake, causing the total number of stakers to fluctuate around the original count of stakers with high probability
2) this is a edge case which is possible((low likelihood but depends upon the minimum stake of the protocol)
   - a malicious user can spam stake and unstake with different accounts 

### Impact

1) unfair gas cost to some users then others
2) The major impact will be  seen on the user who is constantly shifted between tiers as a result of frequent staking and unstaking activity.
3) Can even lead to DoS in the long term when there are a lot of stakers
