# Early Staker Can Lose Tier Priority to Later Staker After Partial Unstake Below Minimum Threshold

### Summary

The `LayerEdgeStaking` contract is designed with a tiered staking system where earlier stakers (determined by a lower, sequentially [assigned ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L68C1-L68C2)`joinId`) are intended to have priority for higher, more favorable tiers (`Tier1` > `Tier2` > `Tier3`). The invariant implies that if `stakerA.joinId < stakerB.joinId`, then `Tier(stakerA)` should be numerically less than or equal to `Tier(stakerB)` (e.g., `Tier.Tier1` (enum 1) <= `Tier.Tier2` (enum 2)).

This FCFS priority can be violated. If an early staker (Staker E) unstakes a portion of their tokens such that their staked balance falls below the `minStakeAmount`, they are marked as `outOfTree`. Consequently, the `getCurrentTier()` function will return `Tier.Tier3` for Staker E, regardless of their original `joinId`. Simultaneously, the `stakerCountInTree` (the count of active stakers eligible for `Tier1` & `Tier2`) decreases. This reduction can lead to later stakers (Staker L, with `joinId_L > joinId_E`) being promoted to higher tiers (e.g., `Tier1` or `Tier2`) because the tier thresholds (calculated as percentages of `stakerCountInTree`) adjust, and their relative rank among the remaining `inTree` stakers improves.

In such a scenario, Staker E (who joined earlier and has a lower `joinId`) ends up in `Tier.Tier3`, while Staker L (who joined later with a higher `joinId`) could be in `Tier.Tier1` or `Tier.Tier2`. This results in `Tier(StakerE)` > `Tier(StakerL)` numerically, directly violating the FCFS tier priority invariant.

### Root Cause

The violation stems from the interaction of three main mechanisms:

1.  **`outOfTree` Status Leading to Fixed `Tier3`:** When a staker's balance drops below `minStakeAmount` due to an unstake (and they were not previously `outOfTree`), their `user.outOfTree` flag is set to `true`. The `getCurrentTier()` function unconditionally returns `Tier.Tier3` for any user whose `outOfTree` flag is true. This effectively demotes the staker to the lowest tier permanently, irrespective of their original `joinId`.
2.  **Tier Re-calculation for Remaining Stakers:** When a staker becomes `outOfTree` and is removed from the `stakerTree` (the Fenwick tree used for ranking), the `stakerCountInTree` decreases. The `_checkBoundariesAndRecord` function is then triggered. This function re-evaluates tier assignments for stakers at the tier boundaries. Due to the reduced `stakerCountInTree`, other, later stakers might see their rank improve relative to the new tier thresholds and get promoted to a better tier.
3.  **Order of Operations in `_unstake`:** When a user unstakes below `minStakeAmount`:
    *   They are first explicitly assigned `Tier.Tier3` via `_recordTierChange(userAddr, Tier.Tier3)`.
    *   Their `outOfTree` status is set.
    *   Then, `_checkBoundariesAndRecord` is called, which may promote other stakers. This sequence ensures the early unstaker is demoted before any potential promotions for others occur.

### Internal Pre-conditions

*   At least two stakers, an "Early Staker" (E) and a "Late Staker" (L), exist in the system, both having staked amounts greater than or equal to `minStakeAmount`.
*   `users[E].joinId < users[L].joinId`.
*   Initially, the FCFS invariant holds: `Tier(E) <= Tier(L)`.
*   Staker E has a staked balance such that unstaking a certain amount will cause their balance to drop below `minStakeAmount`.
*   The current `stakerCountInTree` and tier percentage configurations (`TIER1_PERCENTAGE`, `TIER2_PERCENTAGE`) are such that when E is removed from the `stakerTree`, Staker L (or another staker with `joinId > E.joinId`) is eligible for promotion to a tier better than `Tier.Tier3`.

### External Pre-conditions

*   The Early Staker (E) calls the `unstake()` or `unstakeNative()` function.
*   The `amount` specified in the unstake call is such that `users[E].balance - amount < minStakeAmount`.
*   The unstake call occurs after the `UNSTAKE_WINDOW` has passed since Staker E's last relevant deposit or stake: `block.timestamp >= users[E].depositTime + UNSTAKE_WINDOW`.

### Attack Path

Let `minStakeAmount = 1000 tokens`, `TIER1_PERCENTAGE = 20%`, `TIER2_PERCENTAGE = 30%`.

1.  **Initial State (5 Stakers):**
    *   Alice stakes 1000 tokens. `Alice.joinId = 1`.
    *   Bob stakes 1000 tokens. `Bob.joinId = 2`.
    *   Charlie stakes 1000 tokens. `Charlie.joinId = 3`.
    *   Dave stakes 1000 tokens. `Dave.joinId = 4`.
    *   Eve stakes 1000 tokens. `Eve.joinId = 5`.
    *   `stakerCountInTree = 5`.
    *   Tier distribution (based on `getTierCountForStakerCount(5)`):
        *   Tier1: 1 staker (`5 * 20% = 1`)
        *   Tier2: 1 staker (`5 * 30% = 1.5`, effectively 1 after Tier1)
        *   Tier3: 3 stakers
    *   Current Tiers:
        *   Alice (rank 1, `joinId=1`): `Tier.Tier1`
        *   Bob (rank 2, `joinId=2`): `Tier.Tier2`
        *   Charlie (rank 3, `joinId=3`): `Tier.Tier3`
        *   Dave (rank 4, `joinId=4`): `Tier.Tier3`
        *   Eve (rank 5, `joinId=5`): `Tier.Tier3`
    *(At this point, FCFS holds: `Tier(Alice) < Tier(Bob) < Tier(Charlie) = Tier(Dave) = Tier(Eve)`)*.

2.  **Alice Unstakes Below Minimum:**
    Alice (`joinId=1`, currently `Tier.Tier1`) unstakes 1 token. Her balance drops from 1000 to 999 tokens, which is below `minStakeAmount`.
    *   Inside `_unstake` for Alice:
        *   `_updateInterest(Alice)` is called.
        *   Alice's `balance` becomes 999.
        *   The condition `!users[Alice].outOfTree && users[Alice].balance < minStakeAmount` is true.
            *   `_recordTierChange(Alice, Tier.Tier3)`: Alice's tier is recorded as changing to `Tier.Tier3`.
            *   `stakerTree.update(Alice.joinId, -1)`: Alice is removed from the Fenwick tree.
            *   `stakerCountInTree` decreases from 5 to 4.
            *   `users[Alice].outOfTree = true`.
            *   `_checkBoundariesAndRecord(true)` is called with `n=4` (new count) and `oldN=5`.
                *   Old tier counts (for 5 stakers): `old_t1=1, old_t2=1`.
                *   New tier counts (for 4 stakers, via `getTierCountForStakerCount(4)`):
                    *   Tier1: 1 staker (`4 * 20% = 0.8 -> 1`)
                    *   Tier2: 1 staker (`4 * 30% = 1.2 -> 1` after Tier1)
                    *   Tier3: 2 stakers
                *   `_findAndRecordTierChange` is called for rank 1 (new Tier1 boundary) and rank 2 (new Tier2 boundary).
                    *   Bob (`joinId=2`), now rank 1 among 4 stakers, is promoted from `Tier.Tier2` to `Tier.Tier1`. `_recordTierChange(Bob, Tier.Tier1)`.
                    *   Charlie (`joinId=3`), now rank 2 among 4 stakers, is promoted from `Tier.Tier3` to `Tier.Tier2`. `_recordTierChange(Charlie, Tier.Tier2)`.
    *   Alice receives her 1 token.

3.  **Final State & Invariant Violation:**
    *   Alice: `joinId=1`, `outOfTree=true`. `getCurrentTier(Alice)` returns `Tier.Tier3`.
    *   Bob: `joinId=2`, `inTree=true`. `getCurrentTier(Bob)` returns `Tier.Tier1`.
    *   Charlie: `joinId=3`, `inTree=true`. `getCurrentTier(Charlie)` returns `Tier.Tier2`.
    *   Dave: `joinId=4`, `inTree=true`. `getCurrentTier(Dave)` returns `Tier.Tier3` (now rank 3 of 4).
    *   Eve: `joinId=5`, `inTree=true`. `getCurrentTier(Eve)` returns `Tier.Tier3` (now rank 4 of 4).

    Comparing Alice (`joinId=1`) and Bob (`joinId=2`):
    *   `Alice.joinId < Bob.joinId`.
    *   Expected according to FCFS invariant: `Tier(Alice) <= Tier(Bob)`.
    *   Actual: `Tier(Alice) = Tier.Tier3` (numeric value 3), `Tier(Bob) = Tier.Tier1` (numeric value 1).
    *   `3 <= 1` is **FALSE**. The FCFS tier priority invariant is violated.


### Impact

*   **Broken Invariant:** The core FCFS promise for tier allocation is not consistently upheld. Users expecting their early staking position (`joinId`) to perpetually grant them better or equal tier priority (as long as they are staked) will find this is not true if they dip below `minStakeAmount`.
*   **Potential Unfairness:** Early supporters who make a small withdrawal taking them below the `minStakeAmount` threshold are harshly penalized by being permanently moved to `Tier.Tier3`. Meanwhile, later stakers can benefit from this situation by being promoted. This may not align with user expectations of how early contributions are valued.
*   **Reduced User Confidence:** Observing this behavior—where an earlier staker ends up in a worse tier than a later one due to a minor withdrawal—can erode trust in the staking system's fairness and predictability.
