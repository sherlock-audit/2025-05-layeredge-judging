# Funds (Native ETH from WETH) Can Be Trapped if Native ETH Transfer Fails During Unstake/Claim

### Summary

When a user performs `completeUnstakeNative()` or `claimInterestNative()`, the contract first converts its WETH holdings (assumed to be the `stakingToken` for native operations) to ETH by calling `IWETH.withdraw()`. It then attempts to send this ETH to the user. If the ETH transfer to the user fails (e.g., the user is a contract that reverts on ETH receipt), the entire transaction reverts.

### Root Cause

1. In `_completeUnstake` (when `isNative` is true) and `_claimInterest` (when `isNative` is true), the contract calls `IWETH(address(stakingToken)).withdraw(amount)`. This call converts WETH held by `LayerEdgeStaking` into ETH, effectively changing `LayerEdgeStaking`'s WETH balance to ETH balance. This is an external call to the WETH contract.
        2. Subsequently, `LayerEdgeStaking` attempts to send this ETH to `userAddr` using `payable(userAddr).call{value: amount}("")`.
        3. If `userAddr.call` fails, the entire `completeUnstakeNative` or `claimInterestNative` transaction reverts.
        4. While the internal state of `LayerEdgeStaking` (e.g., `request.completed`, `user.interestEarned`) is rolled back, the effect of the successful `IWETH.withdraw()` call (the WETH-to-ETH conversion in `LayerEdgeStaking`'s balance) is *not* rolled back. The WETH contract processed the withdrawal, and `LayerEdgeStaking` now holds ETH instead of WETH for that amount.

### Internal Pre-conditions

        - `stakingToken` is set to the WETH contract address.
        - A user has staked WETH via `stakeNative()`.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

In _completeUnstake ['approx. L769-L772'](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L769-L772):
In _claimInterest ['approx. 800-803'](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L800-803):    
```solidity
else {
     IWETH(address(stakingToken)).withdraw(request.amount); // WETH converted to ETH within LayerEdgeStaking
     (bool success,) = payable(userAddr).call{value: request.amount}(""); // This call fails
     require(success, "Unstake native transfer failed");
}

 else {
     IWETH(address(stakingToken)).withdraw(claimable); // WETH converted to ETH within LayerEdgeStaking
     (bool success,) = payable(userAddr).call{value: claimable}(""); // This call fails
     require(success, "Claim interest native transfer failed");
 }
```

### Impact

 - **Loss of Funds:** Users' unstaked principal or claimed interest (originally WETH, converted to ETH by the contract) can become permanently trapped within the `LayerEdgeStaking` contract if the user's address is a contract that cannot receive ETH or causes the ETH transfer to revert.
        - **Denial of Service for Unstake/Claim:** Affected users will be unable to complete their unstake or claim their interest for native operations.
