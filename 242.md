# Contract logic will cause incorrect tier assignment for stakers

### Summary

The tier assignment logic in the `LayerEdgeStaking` contract will cause an incorrect tier distribution for stakers as the contract will assign fewer users to Tier 2 than expected at certain user counts due to integer division and lack of explicit rounding, resulting in off-by-one errors at tier boundaries.

### Root Cause

In `LayerEdgeStaking.sol` [https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L480C14-L480C40](getTierCountForStakerCount()) the calculation of tier boundaries uses integer division (userCount * 20 / 100 and userCount * 30 / 100) without explicit rounding or minimums, causing some user counts to have fewer users in Tier 2 than expected. Example: For 10 users, Tier 2 is expected to have 3 users (30%), but only 2 are assigned.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Stakers must call stake() to add themselves to the pool.
The total number of stakers must be a value where integer division truncates (e.g., 8â€“12 users).
The contract must use the current tier assignment logic.

### External Pre-conditions

The users are able to stake.


### Attack Path

Multiple users stake, bringing the total staker count to a value where tier division truncates (e.g., 10 users).
The contract assigns users to tiers using integer division.
The number of users in Tier 2 is less than the expected 30% (e.g., 1 instead of 2 for 10 users).
Some users receive lower rewards or privileges than intended.

### Impact

The stakers suffer an approximate loss of expected rewards or privileges due to being assigned to a lower tier than intended. This can result in unfair distribution of rewards and undermine user trust in the protocol.

        assertEq(t2, expectedT2, "Tier 2 count mismatch");

        assertEq(t1 + t2 + t3, userCount, "Total tier count mismatch");

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < userCount; i++) {

        }
    }

}

```

### Mitigation

Update the tier assignment logic to use explicit rounding or minimums for small user counts, or document the expected behavior for small pools.
Consider using a more robust algorithm for tier assignment that guarantees the intended percentage split, even for small numbers of users.
