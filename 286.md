# Potential Underflow in `FenwickTree.update` Can Lead to Incorrect Tree State and Inconsistent Accounting

### Summary

Missing overflow check in update function of [FenwickTree](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/library/FenwickTree.sol) library

### Root Cause

The values stored in the tree can be modified using the `update` function in the `FenwickTree` library. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/library/FenwickTree.sol#L13

is the precise line of concern.
The cast to `uint256` that follows will result in an underflow if `self.data[index]` contains a value (for example, 0) and `delta` is a negative integer such that `int256(self.data[index]) + delta` yields a negative value (for example, `0 + (-5) = -5`). When a negative signed integer is cast to an unsigned integer in Solidity, the value wraps around to a very large positive number (for example, `-5` becomes `type(uint256).maximum - 5 + 1~).



### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

overflow will lead to inconsitent states

### Impact

If an underflow occurs, the affected `self.data[index]` will store an extremely large, incorrect positive value. This corrupts the state of the Fenwick tree. Consequently, all subsequent calls to `query(index)` that rely on this corrupted node, and calls to `findByCumulativeFrequency()`, will return erroneous results.

The severity is assessed as Medium because exploiting this might require specific conditions (e.g., `self.data[index]` being smaller than the absolute value of a negative `delta`), and the direct financial impact depends on the specific application of the Fenwick tree, which is not fully detailed here. However, data integrity corruption in a core data structure is a significant issue.


_Even if the current implementation of `LayerEdgeStaking.sol` is not directly vulnerable to exploitation through this particular underflow, it is imperative that this vulnerability within the `FenwickTree` library be fixed. By their very nature, libraries are meant to be used in a variety of contexts, sometimes without the original developers' knowledge._

_*The Cetus hack, where an overflow bug in a dependency reportedly resulted in large financial losses, is a clear reminder of the potentially disastrous effects of vulnerabilities in the underlying [intermate](https://github.com/CetusProtocol/cetus-clmm-interface/commit/1402fcab87160dfb81b9f3e91d0213edd4026455) library code. It is crucial to avoid problems like this underflow in order to guarantee the stability of fundamental components like `FenwickTree`. In addition to protecting the current system, this improves the library's dependability and reusability for upcoming projects by stopping similar vulnerabilities from spreading to other protocols._

### Mitigation


```solidity
while (index <= self.size) {
    int256 currentValueSigned = int256(self.data[index]);
    int256 newValueSigned = currentValueSigned + delta;

    require(newValueSigned >= 0, "FenwickTree: Value cannot be negative"); // Prevent underflow
    self.data[index] = uint256(newValueSigned);

    index += lsb(index);
}
```
