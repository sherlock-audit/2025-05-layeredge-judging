# Misconfiguration Leads to Permanent Fenwick Tree Bloat and Unfair Tier Skewing for Stakers

**Summary**
*   The ability to set `minStakeAmount` to zero in `LayerEdgeStaking.sol` will cause an unfair tier advantage for "ghost" stakers and a disadvantage for new, legitimate stakers, as the contract owner will set `minStakeAmount` to `0`, allowing users to stake, then unstake their full balance while remaining in the Fenwick tree, thus artificially inflating `stakerCountInTree` and skewing tier calculations.

**Root Cause**
*   In `LayerEdgeStaking.sol:_unstake` (L629), the condition `user.balance < minStakeAmount` is used to determine if a user should be removed from the `stakerTree`. If `minStakeAmount` is set to `0` by the admin, this condition becomes `user.balance < 0`, which is always false for a `uint256 user.balance`. Consequently, users who unstake their entire balance (making `user.balance = 0`) are not removed from the `stakerTree`.

**Internal Pre-conditions**
1.  Admin needs to call `setMinStakeAmount(0)` to set `minStakeAmount` to be exactly `0`.
2.  At least one user (`stakerA`) needs to call `stake()` with an amount `X > 0` while `minStakeAmount` is `0`.
3.  `stakerA` needs to call `unstake(X)` to reduce their `balance` to exactly `0`.

**External Pre-conditions**
*   None.

**Attack Path**
1.  The contract owner (`admin`) calls `setMinStakeAmount(0)`.
2.  `stakerA` calls `stakingToken.approve(address(contract), 100 ether)` and then `contract.stake(100 ether)`.
    *   `stakerA` is added to `stakerTree`. `stakerCountInTree` becomes 1. `users[stakerA].outOfTree` is `false`. `users[stakerA].isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake` is `true`.
3.  `stakerA` calls `contract.unstake(100 ether)`.
    *   `users[stakerA].balance` becomes `0`.
    *   The check `!user.outOfTree && user.balance < minStakeAmount` (L629) becomes `!false && 0 < 0`, which is `true && false` => `false`.
    *   `stakerA` is NOT removed from `stakerTree`. `stakerCountInTree` remains 1. `users[stakerA].outOfTree` remains `false`.
4.  A new staker, `stakerB`, calls `stakingToken.approve(address(contract), 5000 ether)` and then `contract.stake(5000 ether)`.
    *   `stakerB` is added to `stakerTree`. `stakerCountInTree` becomes 2.
    *   When `getCurrentTier(stakerB)` is calculated, `stakerCountInTree` (value: 2) is used. `stakerA` (rank 1, balance 0) occupies the first slot, potentially taking Tier 1. `stakerB` (rank 2) is pushed to Tier 2 or Tier 3, despite `stakerA` having no active stake.

**Impact**
*   Legitimate stakers (`stakerB`) suffer from unfairly skewed tier calculations, potentially receiving lower APY than they should because the tier system is diluted by zero-balance "ghost" stakers (`stakerA`). The `stakerCountInTree` becomes an inaccurate measure of active, eligible stakers. This undermines the FCFS principle and tier distribution correctness invariants.

**Mitigation**
*   In `setMinStakeAmount(uint256 amount)`, add `require(amount > 0, "Min stake amount must be > 0");`.
*   Alternatively, modify the `_unstake` logic at L629 to:
    ```solidity
    if (!user.outOfTree && (user.balance == 0 || (minStakeAmount > 0 && user.balance < minStakeAmount))) {
        // ... existing removal logic ...
    }
    ```
    And ensure `user.isActive` is set to `false` when `user.balance` becomes `0`.
