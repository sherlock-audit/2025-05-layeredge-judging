# Unstaking Griefing Risk

# Summary
The lack of rate limiting in the unstaking mechanism of [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L518-L552](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L518-L552) will cause denial of service for all users as attackers can flood the system with unstaking requests.

## Root Cause
The unstaking mechanism in [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L518-L552](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L518-L552) allows unlimited unstaking requests:

```solidity
function _unstake(uint256 amount) internal {
    UserInfo storage user = users[msg.sender];
    require(user.isActive, "User not active");
    require(amount > 0 && amount <= user.stakedAmount, "Invalid amount");

    // @audit No rate limiting on unstake requests
    user.stakedAmount -= amount;
    if (user.stakedAmount < minStakeAmount) {
        _removeFromTree(user.joinId);
    }
    
    // @audit Each unstake triggers expensive tier recalculations
    _checkBoundariesAndRecord(true);
}
```

This allows griefing attacks through system resource exhaustion. The issue is made worse by the tier recalculation in [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L644-L708](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L644-L708) which is called for each unstake.

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. Attacker must have sufficient stake to initiate multiple unstake requests
2. Contract must be processing tier updates on unstake
3. No rate limiting on unstake operations

## External Pre-conditions
1. Network must be able to handle multiple transactions from same address
2. Gas prices must be low enough to make attack economically feasible

## Attack Path
1. Attacker stakes minimum required amount
2. Attacker initiates multiple small unstaking requests in rapid succession
3. Each request triggers tier recalculation
4. System resources get consumed processing updates
5. Other users' transactions get delayed or fail due to increased gas costs

## Impact
The protocol suffers degraded performance and increased gas costs. Users experience transaction delays and failures. The attacker loses only transaction fees while causing widespread disruption to protocol operations.

        staking.stake{value: INITIAL_STAKE}();
    }
    
    function testUnstakeGriefing() public {

        for(uint i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            vm.prank(attacker);
            staking.unstake(UNSTAKE_AMOUNT);
            
            // Verify each unstake triggers system updates
            assertTrue(staking.getPendingUnstakeCount(attacker) > i);
        }
        
        // Verify system state after attack
        uint256 gasUsed = gasleft();
        staking.processUnstakeRequests();
        uint256 gasConsumed = gasUsed - gasleft();
        
        // Gas consumption should be significant
        assertTrue(gasConsumed > 1000000);
    }
}
```

## Mitigation
1. Implement rate limiting for unstaking in [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L518](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L518):

```solidity
struct UnstakeLimit {
    uint256 lastUnstakeTime;
    uint256 unstakeCount;
}

mapping(address => UnstakeLimit) private unstakeLimits;

function unstake(uint256 amount) external {
    UnstakeLimit storage limit = unstakeLimits[msg.sender];
    
    // Reset counter if new period
    if (block.timestamp > limit.lastUnstakeTime + 1 hours) {
        limit.unstakeCount = 0;
        limit.lastUnstakeTime = block.timestamp;
    }
    
    require(limit.unstakeCount < MAX_UNSTAKES_PER_HOUR, "Rate limit exceeded");
    limit.unstakeCount++;
    
    // Process unstake...
}
```

2. Add cooldown period between unstake requests
3. Implement batch processing for unstaking
4. Add minimum unstake amounts
5. Consider implementing unstaking fees that increase with frequency
