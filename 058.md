# User will receive inaccurate interest as compoundInterest() skips tier recalculation logic

### Summary

The direct addition of rewards to a user’s stake via compoundInterest() will cause inaccurate interest calculation for stakers as the contract will not recalculate their tier after compounding changes their balance significantly.

### Root Cause

In [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#213](https://github.com/zaid261-spec/2025-05-layeredge-zaid261-spec/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L213), the `compoundInterest()` function updates `user.balance` and `totalStaked`, but fails to trigger a tier recalculation. This results in a mismatch between the user’s actual stake and their assigned APY tier.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User must have enough earned rewards to push their balance across a tier boundary.
2. User must call compoundInterest().

### External Pre-conditions

None required — the issue is isolated to on-chain staking logic.

### Attack Path

1. User stakes just below Tier 2 threshold.
2. Over time, they accumulate enough interest.
3. They call compoundInterest() which adds tokens to balance.
4. Their rank and tier are not updated despite now qualifying for Tier 2.
5. User continues earning based on old (lower) APY, under-rewarded until they stake again or trigger a tier update by other means.

### Impact

The user suffers an approximate loss of interest due to tier promotion being skipped. This can cause long-term reward loss for active users who rely on compounding.

### PoC

// Simulate user who starts at rank 1001 (Tier 3), compounds to move to rank 999 (Tier 2)
// Observe: getCurrentTier() returns Tier 3 even after balance increases


### Mitigation

After compounding, trigger _recordTierChange() and check if joinId rank crosses tier thresholds. Optionally emit a TierChanged event.
