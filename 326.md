# Failure to Enforce MAX_USERS Cap in LayerEdgeStaking Contract

### Summary

The absence of a check for `nextJoinId <= MAX_USERS` in the `_stake` function allows users to stake beyond the `MAX_USERS` cap, as the contract assigns a `joinId` and processes stakes even when the Fenwick Tree’s capacity is exceeded, violating the intended user limit.


### Root Cause

In the[ `_stake` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L700-L713), the contract does not verify if the `MAX_USERS` limit has been reached before assigning `user.joinId = nextJoinId++` and calling the Fenwick tree's update function. This allows more users to continue staking even when `MAX_USERS` limit has been reached.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.  The contract is initialized with `MAX_USERS` set to any value.
2. Users stake at least `minStakeAmount` until `stakerCountInTree` reaches `MAX_USERS`.
3. A new user stakes at least `minStakeAmount` to trigger `nextJoinId++` when `nextJoinId > MAX_USERS`.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. The contract is initialized with `MAX_USERS` set to 100_000_000
2. `MAX_USERS` users stake at least `minStakeAmount`, until `stakerCountInTree = MAX_USERS`.
3. A new user stakes an amount of tokens that is >= `minStakeAmount`.
4. The `_stake` function assigns `user.joinId = nextJoinId++` without checking if `nextJoinId <= MAX_USERS`.
5. The stake is processed, `stakerCountInTree` increments, and `totalStaked` is updated.
6. The user is recorded as active with a valid stake, bypassing the `MAX_USERS` cap.

### Impact

Users can stake beyond the `MAX_USERS` cap, violating the contract’s intended limit. This allows an unlimited number of users to participate, and also undermines the protocol’s design, which aims to restrict staking to a fixed number of users. Hence, a core invariant has not been enforced.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure that MAX_USERS is not exceeded by checking in the `_stake` function before the stake is processed.
