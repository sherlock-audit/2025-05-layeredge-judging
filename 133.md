# üîí High Severity: Admin can block staking by setting an unbounded minStakeAmount

## üß® Issue: Admin can block staking by setting an unbounded `minStakeAmount`

**File:** `edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol`  
**Line:** 615  

```solidity
require(amount >= minStakeAmount, "Cannot stake less than minimum");
```

This line checks whether the user is staking at least the `minStakeAmount`, which is fully controlled by the contract owner via `setMinStakeAmount()`. There is **no upper limit** enforced, meaning the owner can set this value arbitrarily high (e.g., `2**256 - 1`), effectively **blocking all new staking operations**.

This centralization of power introduces a serious risk, as the staking process becomes dependent on a single actor's decision.

---

### üîê Impact

- The owner can **unilaterally prevent new users from staking**.
- Existing users may gain unfair advantages in tier allocation due to reduced competition.
- Undermines the protocol‚Äôs trust and openness, especially in a decentralized context.

---

### ‚úÖ Recommendation

Add an upper bound to `minStakeAmount`, or enforce a maximum cap via a constant, for example:

```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_MIN_STAKE = 1_000_000 * 1e18;

function setMinStakeAmount(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    require(amount <= MAX_MIN_STAKE, "minStakeAmount too high");
    minStakeAmount = amount;
}
```

Additionally, consider introducing a **delay mechanism** or governance-controlled flow for critical parameter changes to limit the possibility of abuse.
