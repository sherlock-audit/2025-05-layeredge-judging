# The protocol lacks fee implementation

### Summary

The protocol does not take account of fees that should be gotten from users from participating in their protocol, these fees are often used for various purposes in the ecosystem, some of this fees usually goes to the protocolâ€™s treasury, which funds ongoing development, audits, marketing, and community initiative. But in the this protocol, no fee was deducted from the users.

### Root Cause

Fees are not deducted from the users, which in turn will lead to the protocol incurring bad debt. When a user, maybe a whale deposits some assets as rewards, there is no form of incentive for the user.

### Internal Pre-conditions

no response

### External Pre-conditions

no response

### Attack Path

no response

### Impact

The protocol will be running at loss here, users come into the protocol, stakes some assets generates rewards, and unstake their assets while the protocol earns nothing from it.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider implementing fee calculations to appropriately deduct fees users before they claim rewards or before they completely unstake their assets.
