# Inadequate implementation for `withdrawRewards` may lead to rewards getting permanenly stucked.

### Summary

A user can send some amount of tokens by calling `WETH9::transfer()` or `WETH9::transferFrom()`. When a user sends tokens through either of this function,  `rewardsReserve` state will not be accounted for, this implies that the contract assumes that there was no token sent to it. This causes an issue when the admin tries to withdraw rewards. There is a check in the `LayerEdgeStaking::withdrawRewards()` that ensures that the amount to be withdrawn is always  less than  `rewardsReserve`.  This would not be true if  a user sends assets by calling `WETH9::transferFrom()`. Therefore when the admin tries to withdraw all the contract rewards, the function reverts.




### Root Cause

this issue arises from the lack of access control in core functionalities inside the `WETH9` contract, and also when the admin tries to claim rewards there is a check that rewardsReserve should be greater than the amount. which would not be the case if a user sends tokens by calling `transfer()`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. User sends some amount of token to the `layerEdgeStaking` contract by calling `WETH9::transferFrom()`
2. Admin tries to withdraw all rewards from the `layerEdgeStaking`  contract by calling `withdrawRewards()`  and the function reverts.

### Impact

The tokens are permanently  stucked in the  layerEdgeStaking contract

### PoC

To see this clearly
1. add the following getter function to `LayerEdgeStaking.sol` 
```solidity
 function getRewardsReserve() external view returns (uint256) {
        return rewardsReserve;
    }

```

2. Add the following test in the `NativeTokenStakingTest.t.sol` and run `forge test --mt test_compoundPoC -vvv` to view the logs

```solidity
 function test_compoundPoC() public {
           vm.startPrank(user);
        vm.deal(user, REWARDS_AMOUNT );
        //user calls deposit
        IWETH(address(stakingToken)).deposit{value: STAKE_AMOUNT}();
        //user approves the contract to spend the staking token
        IWETH(address(stakingToken)).approve(address(layerEdgeStaking), REWARDS_AMOUNT);
        //user sends stakingToken to layerEdgeStaking by calling transferFrom 
        IWETH(address(stakingToken)).transferFrom(
            user,
            address(layerEdgeStaking),
            500e18
        );    
        vm.stopPrank();

        uint256 initialBalance = weth.balanceOf(address(layerEdgeStaking));
        console2.log("expected token balance:", initialBalance);
       uint256 rewardsReserve = layerEdgeStaking.getRewardsReserve();
       console2.log("token balance from rewardsReserve state ", rewardsReserve);

       //When the admin tries to withdraw all rewards, the contract reverts.
    //    vm.prank(admin);
    //    layerEdgeStaking.withdrawRewards(initialBalance);
    }
```
```bash
 Logs:
  expected token balance: 1000500000000000000000000
  token balance from rewardsReserve state  1000000000000000000000000
```
From the logs, we can see that the main token balance and the `rewardResereve` balances are different. When the admin tries to withdraw the `expectedTokenBalance`, the function reverts.
