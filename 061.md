# Reward reserve can be drained or desynced due to unprotected mutation in claimInterest

### Summary

The early subtraction of rewards from rewardsReserve will cause desync or underflow of funds as the contract updates internal state before completing the transfer.

### Root Cause

In [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#770](https://github.com/zaid261-spec/2025-05-layeredge-zaid261-spec/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L770), the claimInterest() function subtracts the claimable interest from rewardsReserve before transferring it. If transfer() or withdraw() fails (e.g. gas limit, fallback revert), the user's interestEarned is reset while the contract's rewardsReserve remains reduced — permanently desyncing the ledger.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user has accrued interestEarned
2. stakingToken.transfer(...) fails due to any reason (fallback revert, insufficient gas)

### External Pre-conditions

Network congestion or malicious fallback functions

### Attack Path

1. User calls claimInterest()
2. Contract subtracts claimable from rewardsReserve
3. Transfer to user fails
4. User’s interest resets to 0, but reserve is already reduced

### Impact

The contract loses track of reserves, leading to under-distribution of rewards. In repeated cases, this can underpay honest users or prevent claims.

### PoC

// Simulate transfer() revert inside claimInterest()
// rewardsReserve -= claimable; but user receives nothing


### Mitigation

Only update rewardsReserve and user.interestEarned = 0 after a successful transfer. Reorder the statements for atomic accounting.
