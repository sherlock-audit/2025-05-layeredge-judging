# User with smaller interest can Frontrun Other users call to compound/claim interest Creating a DOS Attack

### Summary

The current implementation does not allow users to partially claim/compound their earned interest. This creates a race condition that will cause users to frontrun claim/compound calls just to DOS other users.

### Root Cause

In Staking.sol:compoundInterest() and _claimInterest(), the implementation requires rewardsReserve >= claimable and does not allow partial claiming/compounding. This leads to revert-on-failure behavior when rewardsReserve is insufficient, allowing attackers to race others for reward just to DOS other users.


 ```solidity
 function _claimInterest(address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
        _updateInterest(userAddr);

        UserInfo storage user = users[userAddr];
        uint256 claimable = user.interestEarned;

        require(claimable > 0, "Nothing to claim");

@audit>>          // Check if we have enough rewards in the contract
@audit>>          require(rewardsReserve >= claimable, "Insufficient rewards in contract");

        user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;
  
 @audit>>       user.interestEarned = 0;
     
      user.totalClaimed += claimable;

                // Update rewards reserve
  @audit>>        rewardsReserve -= claimable;

        // Transfer tokens to user
        if (!isNative) {
            require(stakingToken.transfer(userAddr, claimable), "Token transfer failed");
        } else {
            IWETH(address(stakingToken)).withdraw(claimable);
            (bool success,) = payable(userAddr).call{value: claimable}("");
            require(success, "Claim interest native transfer failed");
        }

        emit RewardClaimed(userAddr, claimable);
    }

```

 ```solidity
  /**
     * @notice Compound interest by adding it to staked balance
     */
    function compoundInterest() external whenCompoundingEnabled nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        _updateInterest(msg.sender);

        UserInfo storage user = users[msg.sender];
        uint256 claimable = user.interestEarned;

        require(claimable > 0, "Nothing to compound");

@audit>>          // Check if we have enough rewards in the contract
@audit>>          require(rewardsReserve >= claimable, "Insufficient rewards in contract");

        // Update rewards reserve
@audit>>        rewardsReserve -= claimable;

        // Add earned interest to staked balance
        user.balance += claimable;
        totalStaked += claimable;

        // Reset interest tracking
        user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;
@audit>>          user.interestEarned = 0;
        user.totalClaimed += claimable;

        // Determine user's tier for event (might have changed due to increased balance)
        Tier tier = getCurrentTier(msg.sender);

        emit RewardClaimed(msg.sender, claimable);
        emit Staked(msg.sender, claimable, tier);
    }
 ```


Instead of revert we should update the users earned amount the same way we update the rewardsReserve.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user (victim) has a claimable interest larger than a front-runnerâ€™s (e.g., 900 tokens).

2. There is no batching or priority queue logic enforcing fairness in compounding/claiming.

3. The front-runner has a smaller pending interest (e.g., 10 tokens).

### External Pre-conditions

1. The front-runner (standard on public Ethereum).

2. Gas prices allow for transaction ordering (e.g., via MEV or higher gas fees).

3. Multiple users try to claim or compound interest in a tight time window.

### Attack Path

1. User A (victim) broadcasts a compoundInterest() call to claim 900 tokens.

2. User B (attacker) sends a compoundInterest() transaction for 10 tokens with higher gas.

3. Attacker's transaction is mined first, reducing rewardsReserve to 890.

4. Victim's transaction reverts with "Insufficient rewards in contract".

5. Attacker can repeat this pattern, griefing other users and locking them out of claiming or compounding their rewards.

### Impact

The affected users cannot execute their compoundInterest() or claimInterest() calls. This is a denial-of-service attack where the attacker loses nothing and causes operational failure for honest users by repeatedly front-running with smaller claims.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Allow users to partially claim or compound based on available rewardsReserve instead of reverting entirely. Modify the logic to:

Cap the claimable amount to the available rewardsReserve if claimable is > then present rewardreserve.
