# Active Compounder will Dilute Available Rewards for Passive Stakers

### Summary

The design of reward compounding in `LayerEdgeStaking.sol` will cause a dilution of rewards for passive stakers, as an active compounder will increase their principal stake and draw a disproportionately larger share from the finite `rewardsReserve` by repeatedly calling [`compoundInterest()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L213).

### Root Cause

The `compoundInterest` function adds accrued interest back to the staked balance, thereby increasing the base for future reward calculations for that user. Since all rewards are drawn from a shared, finite `rewardsReserve`, a user who compounds frequently will see their balance grow, allowing them to claim an increasingly larger absolute amount of rewards in subsequent periods. This depletes the `rewardsReserve` more rapidly, reducing the total rewards effectively available to other, less active stakers over time.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The `rewardsReserve` in contains sufficient tokens to cover the compounding interest amounts.
2. The compounding is enabled.
3. The "Attacker" has an active stake (`users[attacker].balance > 0`) and has accrued claimable interest (`calculateUnclaimedInterest(attacker) > 0`).
4. Other stakers ("Passive Stakers") are comparatively less active, meaning they call `compoundInterest()` or `claimInterest()` less frequently than the Attacker.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1.  **Attacker calls `stake()` to deposit an initial amount of tokens.** (Other Passive Stakers also deposit their tokens.)
2.  **Time passes** (blocks are produced), allowing rewards to accrue for all stakers based on their current balance and tier APY.
3.  **Attacker calls `compoundInterest()`**. This action adds their accrued interest to their `users[attacker].balance` and updates `totalStaked`. The compounded amount is withdrawn from `rewardsReserve`.
4.  **Repeat steps 2 and 3 multiple times.** With each cycle, the Attacker's `balance` increases, leading to a larger base for the next reward calculation.
5.  **Passive Stakers either do not compound or do so much less frequently.**
6.  **Outcome:** The Attacker's share of `totalStaked` grows. When Passive Stakers eventually attempt to claim their rewards, they may find the `rewardsReserve` more depleted than if all users compounded/claimed at a similar, lower frequency. The Attacker effectively captures a larger portion of the total rewards distributed from the `rewardsReserve` over the long term.


### Impact

Passive stakers may suffer a reduction in the total rewards they can actually claim from the `rewardsReserve` or see their share of ongoing rewards diminish relative to their initial stake proportion, as the reserve is consumed more aggressively by active compounders. The active compounder gains a larger portion of the total rewards distributed from `rewardsReserve`. The precise magnitude of this dilution would depend on the relative stake sizes, compounding frequency, and the rate at which `rewardsReserve` is replenished versus depleted.

### Mitigation

Consider if this is the expected behavior. If this is expected then clearly document it for users so they
have a chance to collect an appropriate amount of rewards. If this is not expected, consider requiring
that rewards can only be compounded at a specific interval.
