# Tier Boundary Desynchronization in Compound Interest Function

### Summary

The LayerEdge staking protocol's `compoundInterest()` function contains a tier inconsistency vulnerability where compounding interest increases a user's staked balance but fails to trigger the tier boundary recalculation mechanism (`_checkBoundariesAndRecord()`). This leads to inconsistent tier states across the protocol, where some users may remain in lower tiers despite having balances that should promote them, while tier boundaries become desynchronized with actual user distributions.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L213


### Root Cause


The vulnerability stems from the `compoundInterest()` function treating compounded interest as a balance increase without following the same tier management logic as regular staking operations. The function:

1. Increases the user's balance directly: `user.balance += claimable`
2. Updates total staked amount: `totalStaked += claimable`
3. Calls `getCurrentTier()` for event emission only
4. **Does not to call `_checkBoundariesAndRecord()`** to update tier boundaries

```solidity
function compoundInterest() external whenCompoundingEnabled nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    _updateInterest(msg.sender);

    UserInfo storage user = users[msg.sender];
    uint256 claimable = user.interestEarned;

    require(claimable > 0, "Nothing to compound");
    require(rewardsReserve >= claimable, "Insufficient rewards in contract");

    rewardsReserve -= claimable;

    // VULNERABILITY: Balance increased without tier boundary updates
    user.balance += claimable;
    totalStaked += claimable;

    user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;
    user.interestEarned = 0;
    user.totalClaimed += claimable;

    // Only gets current tier for event - doesn't update boundaries
    Tier tier = getCurrentTier(msg.sender);

    emit RewardClaimed(msg.sender, claimable);
    emit Staked(msg.sender, claimable, tier);
    // Missing: _checkBoundariesAndRecord() call
}
```

In contrast, the regular `_stake()` function properly handles tier boundary updates:

```solidity
function _stake(uint256 amount, address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
    // ... transfer logic ...
    
    user.balance += amount;
    totalStaked += amount;
    
    // CORRECT: Calls tier boundary update logic
    _checkBoundariesAndRecord(false);
    
    emit Staked(userAddr, amount, tier);
}
```
So does the `_unstake()` if user has unstaked a lot and is not out of tree
```solidity
        if (!user.outOfTree && user.balance < minStakeAmount) {
            // execute this before removing from tree, this will make sure to calculate interest
            //for amount left after unstake
            _recordTierChange(userAddr, Tier.Tier3);
            stakerTree.update(user.joinId, -1);
            stakerCountInTree--;
            user.outOfTree = true;
            stakerCountOutOfTree++;
            _checkBoundariesAndRecord(true);
        }
```


### Internal Pre-conditions


1. Protocol must have compounding enabled (`whenCompoundingEnabled` modifier)
2. Users must have accrued interest available for compounding (`user.interestEarned > 0`)
3. Protocol must have sufficient rewards reserve (`rewardsReserve >= claimable`)
4. Multiple users must be active in the staking tree to create tier boundaries
5. Users must be positioned near tier boundaries where balance increases could trigger tier changes


### External Pre-conditions


1. Users must call `compoundInterest()` instead of claiming and re-staking manually
2. Compounded amounts must be significant enough to potentially affect tier rankings
3. Protocol must have reached sufficient scale where tier boundaries matter (multiple users in different tiers)
4. Time must have passed for users to accumulate meaningful interest for compounding


### Attack Path

### 1. **Natural Exploitation (Unintentional)**
1. User accumulates interest over time
2. User calls `compoundInterest()` to add interest to staked balance
3. User's increased balance should promote them to a higher tier
4. Tier boundaries are not recalculated, leaving user in lower tier
5. User continues earning lower APY despite having higher-tier balance
6. Other users' tier calculations become incorrect due to outdated boundaries

### 2. **Systemic Impact Scenario**
1. Multiple users compound interest over time
2. Tier boundaries become increasingly desynchronized
3. `getCurrentTier()` calculations become inconsistent with actual tier distributions
4. Protocol's tier-based APY system becomes unreliable
5. Users lose trust in tier calculations and fair reward distribution

### Impact

Medium Severity Impact:

1. **Tier System Integrity Compromise**: The core tier-based reward mechanism becomes unreliable and inconsistent

2. **Unfair Reward Distribution**: 
   - Users who compound may receive incorrect APY rates
   - Some users get higher rewards than deserved
   - Others get lower rewards than deserved

3. **Protocol State Inconsistency**:
   - `getCurrentTier()` may return different results than actual tier boundaries
   - Tier history becomes inaccurate
   - Tree rankings become desynchronized with tier assignments

4. **Economic Imbalance**:
   - Tier percentages (20%/30%/50%) become incorrect
   - Reward calculations based on tier become unreliable
   - Long-term protocol economics are affected


### PoC


```solidity
function test_CompoundInterest_TierBoundaryBug_Focused() public {
    // Focused test with exactly the right number of users to demonstrate boundary shifts
    address[6] memory users = [alice, bob, charlie, david, eve, frank];
    uint256 baseStake = 3000 * 1e18;
    
    console2.log("=== FOCUSED TIER BOUNDARY BUG TEST ===");
    
    // Setup users with identical stakes initially
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        vm.startPrank(users[i]);
        token.approve(address(staking), baseStake * 2);
        staking.stake(baseStake);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
    
    console2.log("Initial tiers (6 users, identical stakes):");
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        console2.log("User %d tier: %d", i + 1, uint256(staking.getCurrentTier(users[i])));
    }
    
    // With 6 users: Tier1=1 (20%), Tier2=1 (30%), Tier3=4 (50%)
    
    // Fast forward time
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 365 days);
    
    console2.log("\n=== COMPOUND INTEREST (should change tiers but won't) ===");
    
    // Alice (currently Tier 1) compounds - should potentially affect boundaries
    console2.log("Before Alice compounds:");
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        uint256 interest = staking.calculateUnclaimedInterest(users[i]);
        console2.log("User %d interest: %d tokens, tier: %d", i + 1, interest / 1e18, uint256(staking.getCurrentTier(users[i])));
    }
    
    vm.startPrank(alice);
    staking.compoundInterest();
    vm.stopPrank();
    
    console2.log("\nAfter Alice compounds (balance increased significantly):");
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        (LayerEdgeStaking.UserInfo memory userInfo,,,,) = staking.getAllInfoOfUser(users[i]);
        console2.log("User %d balance: %d tokens, tier: %d", i + 1, userInfo.balance / 1e18, uint256(staking.getCurrentTier(users[i])));
    }
}
```

Output
```bash
  === FOCUSED TIER BOUNDARY BUG TEST ===
  Initial tiers (6 users, identical stakes):
  User 1 tier: 1
  User 2 tier: 2
  User 3 tier: 3
  User 4 tier: 3
  User 5 tier: 3
  User 6 tier: 3
  
=== COMPOUND INTEREST (should change tiers but won't) ===
  Before Alice compounds:
  User 1 interest: 1500 tokens, tier: 1
  User 2 interest: 1050 tokens, tier: 2
  User 3 interest: 600 tokens, tier: 3
  User 4 interest: 600 tokens, tier: 3
  User 5 interest: 600 tokens, tier: 3
  User 6 interest: 600 tokens, tier: 3
  
After Alice compounds (balance increased significantly):
  User 1 balance: 4500 tokens, tier: 1
  User 2 balance: 3000 tokens, tier: 2
  User 3 balance: 3000 tokens, tier: 3
  User 4 balance: 3000 tokens, tier: 3
  User 5 balance: 3000 tokens, tier: 3
  User 6 balance: 3000 tokens, tier: 3
```

We can see tiers did not changed after compounding


This one might show the difference better in unstaking vs compound 

```solidity
function test_CompoundInterest_ForcesTierBoundaryShift() public {
    // Create a scenario that WILL force tier boundary changes
    console2.log("=== FORCED TIER BOUNDARY SHIFT TEST ===");
    
    // Setup: 10 users to get cleaner tier boundaries
    address[10] memory users = [alice, bob, charlie, david, eve, frank, grace, harry, ian, judy];
    uint256 baseStake = 3000 * 1e18;
    
    // Stake with all users
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        vm.startPrank(users[i]);
        token.approve(address(staking), baseStake * 3);
        staking.stake(baseStake);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
    
    // With 10 users: Tier1=2 (20%), Tier2=3 (30%), Tier3=5 (50%)
    console2.log("Initial setup - 10 users, identical stakes:");
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        console2.log("User %d tier: %d", i + 1, uint256(staking.getCurrentTier(users[i])));
    }
    
    // Fast forward for interest accumulation
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 365 days);
    
    // Multiple users compound to create significant balance differences
    console2.log("\n=== MULTIPLE USERS COMPOUND ===");
    
// Array indices for users who will compound
uint256[5] memory compoundingUsers = [uint256(0), uint256(2), uint256(4), uint256(6), uint256(8)];

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        uint256 userIndex = compoundingUsers[i];
        vm.startPrank(users[userIndex]);
        staking.compoundInterest();
        vm.stopPrank();
        console2.log("User %d compounded", userIndex + 1);
    }
    
    console2.log("\nAfter multiple compounds (should have tier changes but might not):");
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        (LayerEdgeStaking.UserInfo memory userInfo,,,,) = staking.getAllInfoOfUser(users[i]);
        console2.log("User %d - Balance: %d, Tier: %d", i + 1, userInfo.balance / 1e18, uint256(staking.getCurrentTier(users[i])));
    }
    
    // Now someone does a regular operation to trigger proper tier updates
    console2.log("\n=== TRIGGER PROPER TIER UPDATE ===");
    
    vm.startPrank(bob); // User 2 (didn't compound)
    staking.unstake(1 * 1e18); // Minimal stake
    vm.stopPrank();
    
    console2.log("\nAfter regular unstake (proper tier boundaries):");
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        (LayerEdgeStaking.UserInfo memory userInfo,,,,) = staking.getAllInfoOfUser(users[i]);
        console2.log("User %d - Balance: %d, Tier: %d", i + 1, userInfo.balance / 1e18, uint256(staking.getCurrentTier(users[i])));
    }
}
```

The second test might show it better
```bash
  === FORCED TIER BOUNDARY SHIFT TEST ===
  Initial setup - 10 users, identical stakes:
  User 1 tier: 1
  User 2 tier: 1
  User 3 tier: 2
  User 4 tier: 2
  User 5 tier: 2
  User 6 tier: 3
  User 7 tier: 3
  User 8 tier: 3
  User 9 tier: 3
  User 10 tier: 3
  
=== MULTIPLE USERS COMPOUND ===
  User 1 compounded
  User 3 compounded
  User 5 compounded
  User 7 compounded
  User 9 compounded
  
After multiple compounds (should have tier changes but might not):
  User 1 - Balance: 4500, Tier: 1
  User 2 - Balance: 3000, Tier: 1
  User 3 - Balance: 4050, Tier: 2
  User 4 - Balance: 3000, Tier: 2
  User 5 - Balance: 4050, Tier: 2
  User 6 - Balance: 3000, Tier: 3
  User 7 - Balance: 3600, Tier: 3
  User 8 - Balance: 3000, Tier: 3
  User 9 - Balance: 3600, Tier: 3
  User 10 - Balance: 3000, Tier: 3
  
=== TRIGGER PROPER TIER UPDATE ===
  
After regular stake (proper tier boundaries):
  User 1 - Balance: 4500, Tier: 1
  User 2 - Balance: 2999, Tier: 3
  User 3 - Balance: 4050, Tier: 2
  User 4 - Balance: 3000, Tier: 2
  User 5 - Balance: 4050, Tier: 3
  User 6 - Balance: 3000, Tier: 3
  User 7 - Balance: 3600, Tier: 3
  User 8 - Balance: 3000, Tier: 3
  User 9 - Balance: 3600, Tier: 3
  User 10 - Balance: 3000, Tier: 3
```
Before regular unstake, user 2 was tier 1 balance 3000, after, balance 2999 and tier 3
Before regular unstake, user 5 was tier 2 balance was 4050, after, balance 4050 and tier 3


### Mitigation


### 1. **Add Tier Boundary Update to Compound Function**

```solidity
function compoundInterest() external whenCompoundingEnabled nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        _updateInterest(msg.sender);

        UserInfo storage user = users[msg.sender];
        uint256 claimable = user.interestEarned;

        require(claimable > 0, "Nothing to compound");
        require(rewardsReserve >= claimable, "Insufficient rewards in contract");

        // Deduct rewards and add to user's stake
        rewardsReserve -= claimable;
        user.balance += claimable;
        totalStaked += claimable;

        // Reset interest tracking
        user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;
        user.interestEarned = 0;
        user.totalClaimed += claimable;

        // --- NEW: Sync Fenwick tree and tier boundaries ---

        // If user was outOfTree but now meets the minStakeAmount, reinsert
        if (user.outOfTree && user.balance >= minStakeAmount) {
            user.joinId = nextJoinId++;
            stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1);
            stakerAddress[user.joinId] = msg.sender;
            user.outOfTree = false;
            stakerCountOutOfTree--;
            stakerCountInTree++;
            _recordTierChange(msg.sender, _computeTierByRank(stakerTree.query(user.joinId), stakerCountInTree));
        }
        // Otherwise, if already inTree, just increase their weight in the Fenwick tree
        else if (!user.outOfTree) {
            stakerTree.update(user.joinId, int256(claimable));
        }

        // Recompute any boundary‐crossing promotions/demotions
        if (!user.outOfTree) {
            _checkBoundariesAndRecord(false);
        }

        // Emit events using the updated tier
        Tier tier = getCurrentTier(msg.sender);
        emit RewardClaimed(msg.sender, claimable);
        emit Staked(msg.sender, claimable, tier);
    }
```
