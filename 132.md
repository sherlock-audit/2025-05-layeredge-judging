# LayerEdgeStaking will delay fund releases for users

### Summary

The "7-day minimum staking period before withdrawals" mechanism in `LayerEdgeStaking.sol` uses the timestamp of the unstake request to start the 7 day timer, rather than the original stake time. This causes a withdrawal delay for users: after calling `unstake()`, they must wait 7 days before they can `completeUnstake()` and receive their tokens.
It is clear that the intended way was to start the timer in the `_stake` function, as stated in documentation and in codebase just before the last update.

### Root Cause

In [LayerEdgeStaking.sol::_unstake](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L752), `UnstakeRequest.timestamp` is initialized to block.timestamp.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user has an active stake.
2. The user calls `unstake(amount)`, which enqueues an `UnstakeRequest` with timestamp = block.timestamp.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User calls `stake(amount)` (or `stakeNative()`) and their tokens are locked in the contract.
2. After 100 days of staking, user calls `unstake(amount)`.
3. The contract records an `UnstakeRequest` with the current block timestamp just at this point.
4. User attempts to call `completeUnstake(index)`: it reverts.
5. After 7 days from step 2, user calls `completeUnstake(index)` again and successfully receives their tokens.

### Impact

Users cannot withdraw their staked tokens until 7 days after they call `unstake()`, not from the time they staked. This may lock usersâ€™ funds longer than intended and could lead to unexpected illiquidity when users assume the unstake window starts at stake time.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Start the timer in `_stake` function. Additionally will have to track the amount.
