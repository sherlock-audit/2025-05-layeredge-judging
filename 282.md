# Missing Re-Entry Logic Locks Honest Users Out of Tiered Staking Tree

### Summary

When a user with an existing stake dips below `minStakeAmount`, they are removed from the internal staking tree—but on any subsequent restake above the threshold, there is no code to re-insert them. As a result, honest users who legitimately top-up can never rejoin Tier 1/2, and global tier counts become permanently incorrect.


### Root Cause


The [`_stake`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L674) function only handles the **first** time a user crosses `minStakeAmount`. It never includes a branch to re-insert users whose `user.outOfTree == true` after topping their balance back over the minimum. Consequently, `stakerCountInTree` is decremented on under-stake but never incremented on re-stake.

```solidity
        if (!user.outOfTree && user.balance < minStakeAmount) {
            // execute this before removing from tree, this will make sure to calculate interest
            //for amount left after unstake
            _recordTierChange(userAddr, Tier.Tier3);
            stakerTree.update(user.joinId, -1);
            stakerCountInTree--;
            user.outOfTree = true;
            stakerCountOutOfTree++;
            _checkBoundariesAndRecord(true);
        }
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user record exists with:  
   - `user.isActive == true`  
   - `user.outOfTree == true`  
   - A valid `user.joinId`.  
2. `stakerCountInTree` and `stakerCountOutOfTree` have been updated when the user first fell below the minimum.


### External Pre-conditions

1. Contract is unpaused.  
2. A user holds ≥ `minStakeAmount` of the staking token off-chain.  
3. User has previously staked ≥ `minStakeAmount`, then under-staked below it.


### Attack Path


1. **Initial Stake ≥ min**  
   - User stakes ≥ `minStakeAmount` for the first time.  
   - Branch for new large stakes fires:  
     - `user.joinId` assigned,  
     - `stakerTree.update(..., +1)`,  
     - `stakerCountInTree++`,  
     - `user.outOfTree = false`.  

2. **Under-stake Below min**  
   - User unstakes enough to make `balance < minStakeAmount`.  
   - In `_unstake`:  
     - `stakerTree.update(..., -1)`,  
     - `stakerCountInTree--`,  
     - `user.outOfTree = true`,  
     - `stakerCountOutOfTree++`.  

3. **Restake Above min (No Re-Entry)**  
   - User stakes again ≥ `minStakeAmount`.  
   - Because `user.isActive == true`, the “first-time” branch is skipped.  
   - No code re-inserts them into the tree:  
     - `stakerCountInTree` remains decremented,  
     - `user.outOfTree` remains true.  


### Impact

- Honest users who dip below the minimum stake are **permanently** excluded from Tier 1 and Tier 2, even after topping up.  
- `stakerCountInTree` and tier boundary calculations become irreversibly incorrect.  
- Users lose access to better APY tiers through no fault of their own.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


Add a re-entry branch in `_stake` to detect and handle `user.outOfTree == true` when the new total stake crosses `minStakeAmount`.
