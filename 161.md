# Native token operations will revert on Ethereum due to stackingToken lacking WETH functions

### Summary

The `LayerEdgeStaking` contract implements native token functionality by casting the `stakingToken` to `IWETH` interface and calling `deposit()` and `withdraw()` methods. However, on Ethereum, the staking token is $EDGEN (a standard ERC20Permit token) which does not implement these methods. This causes all native token operations to revert.

The contract documentation states: "On Ethereum, we use EDGEN, an OpenZeppelin implementation of the ERC20Permit token." Standard ERC20 tokens do not have `deposit()` and `withdraw()` functions that are specific to WETH implementations.

### Affected Functions
- `LayerEdgeStaking::stakeNative()`
- `LayerEdgeStaking::completeUnstakeNative()`  
- `LayerEdgeStaking::claimInterestNative()`

### Root Cause

WETH functions will be incorrectly invoked on ERC20 tokens, resulting in malfunctioning native protocol functionality.

### Impact

Core protocol operations will fail to execute properly

### PoC

1. Deploy `LayerEdgeStaking` on Ethereum ERC20 `stakingToken`
2. User calls `LayerEdgeStaking::stakeNative()` with `msg.value > 0`
3. Function calls `_stake(msg.value, msg.sender, true)` which executes:
   ```solidity
   IWETH(address(stakingToken)).deposit{value: amount}();
   ```
4. The call reverts because EDGEN token does not implement `deposit()` function
5. Similarly, `LayerEdgeStaking::completeUnstakeNative()` and `LayerEdgeStaking::claimInterestNative()` fail when trying to call `withdraw()`

```solidity
// LayerEdgeStaking.sol - Lines 172-174
function stakeNative() external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    _stake(msg.value, msg.sender, true);
}


if (!isNative) {
    require(stakingToken.transferFrom(userAddr, address(this), amount), "Token transfer failed");
} else {
    IWETH(address(stakingToken)).deposit{value: amount}(); // Reverts on Ethereum
}
```

### Mitigation

Deploy a weth instance on the ETH chain and use it as the `stakingToken`. This will allow the contract to use the `deposit()` and `withdraw()` functions on it, and behave the same as on the layerEdge chain.

Adjust `minStakeAmount` in consequences, as the value wont be the same for eth chain and layerEdge chain.
