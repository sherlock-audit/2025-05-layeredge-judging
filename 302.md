# Stakes not tracked by deposit type

### Summary

Stakes not tracked by deposit type allows Alice to withdraw Bob's deposit type, leaving Bob without the ability to withdraw the type he deposited with.

### Root Cause

When users stake in the protocol they have the option to either transfer in the staking token or native `msg.value` and use that to stake. This will work all fine on the LayerEdge L1 where the WETH9 contract will be used.

But on mainnet it will create an issue where users might be forced to withdraw in a different currency than what they deposited with. For example:

1. Alice deposits 100 staking tokens
2. Bob deposits 100 native to stake with it
3. After some time Bob withdraws his 100 but this time in staking tokens, which would pay it out in Alice's tokens
4. Alice's staking tokens are transferred to Bob and when she wishes to withdraw in the same as she deposited, she is not allowed and forced to withdraw in another currency type

From the `_unstake` function we can see that no [checks or enforcement](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L725-L755) is made for the user to unstake in the same token type that they staked with.

```solidity
    function _unstake(uint256 amount, address userAddr) internal {
        UserInfo storage user = users[userAddr];

        // require(user.isActive, "No active stake");
        require(user.balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        // Update interest before changing balance
        _updateInterest(userAddr);

        // Update user balances
        user.balance -= amount;
        user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;

        // Update total staked
        totalStaked -= amount;

        if (!user.outOfTree && user.balance < minStakeAmount) {
            // execute this before removing from tree, this will make sure to calculate interest
            //for amount left after unstake
            _recordTierChange(userAddr, Tier.Tier3);
            stakerTree.update(user.joinId, -1);
            stakerCountInTree--;
            user.outOfTree = true;
            stakerCountOutOfTree++;
            _checkBoundariesAndRecord(true);
        }

        // Add unstake request instead of immediate transfer
        unstakeRequests[userAddr].push(UnstakeRequest({amount: amount, timestamp: block.timestamp, completed: false}));
    }
```

It is unreasonable to force Alice to withdraw in a different type of token than the one she staked with. Instead, accounting should keep track of who deposited what token type and pay it out accordingly upon unstake.
