# User Can Stake Using Multiple Addresses to Artificially Promote Their Main Address to a Higher Tier.

**Description:** 

In the current tiering system, a `user’s` tier is determined solely by their position among all users, based on percentages (e.g., top 20% are Tier 1), and not by the amount staked. When a user joins or leaves, the total user count changes, which recalculates tier boundaries, potentially promoting or demoting users.

An `attacker` can exploit this logic by staking through Sybil addresses (i.e., multiple wallets they control) to inflate the total user count, thereby pushing their main address into a higher tier. Since the number of users in Tier 1 and Tier 2 increases as the total number of users increases (due to rounding of percentages), the `attacker’s` real address may benefit from a tier promotion without doing anything meaningful, while the Sybil `addresses` simply occupy space in `Tier 3`.

**Impact:** 

The `attacker’s` main address is promoted to a higher `tier`, gaining a higher `APY` or better rewards.

**Proof of Concept:**

1. We can assume they are 10 stakers in the protocol who have already staked and have been allocated their tiers with their respected APY's.
   * 20 % of 10 - 2 Users. (`Tier1`).
   * 30 % of 10 - 3 Users. (`Tier2`).
   * 50 % of 10 - 5 Users. (`Tier3`).

2. A user who understands the whole Tier allocation system and who is currently at `Tier3` can stake with multiple addresses thus Promoting his main address to a high Tier with high APY.

Would consider adding this to the `LayerEdgeStakingTest.t.sol`.

```solidity

 function test_ManipulationOfTierAPY() public {

        // Set up initial token balances for tracking
        uint256[] memory initialBalances = new uint256[](10);
        address[10] memory stakers = [alice, bob, charlie, david, eve, frank, grace, harry, ian, judy];

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < stakers.length; i++) {
            initialBalances[i] = token.balanceOf(stakers[i]);
        }

        // Set up 10 stakers
        setupMultipleStakers(10);

        // The last one to stake is Judy and she's currently in Tier 3 meaning that her APY == 30%

        (uint256 tier1Count, uint256 tier2Count, uint256 tier3Count) = staking.getTierCounts();
        assertEq(tier1Count, 2); // 20% of 10 = 2
        assertEq(tier2Count, 3); // 30% of 10 = 3
        assertEq(tier3Count, 5); // Remaining 5 (Judy is probably here).


        assertEq(uint256(staking.getCurrentTier(judy)), uint256(LayerEdgeStaking.Tier.Tier3));

        // At this point , Judy is familiar with the tier recalculation sytem so she uses other addresses to bump up her tier == APY.

           vm.startPrank(judysOtherAddress);
        token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE);
        staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
            vm.stopPrank();

        // After this stake, they are now 11 users in the system.
        (uint256 tier1Count1, uint256 tier2Count2, uint256 tier3Count3) = staking.getTierCounts();
        assertEq(tier1Count1, 2); // 20% of 11 = 2
        assertEq(tier2Count2, 3); // 30% of 11 = 3
        assertEq(tier3Count3, 6); // Rest of users -> 6 users (Judy's position has been shifted to 5th position in Tier 3 )

        // She can keep on doing this with multiple addresses till she promotes her main address to Tier 1

    }

```

Running this test will help get the concept.
   

**Recommended Mitigation:** 

Batch or epoch tier updates to reduce the ability to time or game the tier system.
