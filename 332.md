### Title: 
LayerEdgeStaking::updateTierOnChange tier update may not reflect actual user rank immediately.

Description

The contract uses updateTierOnChange(msg.sender) to check if the user’s tier should change. But the update relies on getRank(msg.sender) and Fenwick Tree state at the time of the call. If stake() or unstake() just happened, the tree may not be fully updated yet. That means the tier update could be wrong or delayed, especially if tier change and interest claim happen close together.

Impact

User might get rewards from wrong tier
If rank isn’t updated in time, calculateUnclaimedInterest() uses the old tier
Can cause overpay or underpay
Breaks FCFS and APY accuracy

Proof of Concepts

1. User unstakes and drops rank

2. They call claimInterest() right after

3. updateTierOnChange() runs, but rank hasn’t been recalculated correctly

4. Tier remains old — rewards paid based on wrong APY
