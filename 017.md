# Tier Distribution Drift

### Summary

The code enforces 20/30/50% tier splits, but edge cases (very low user counts) can break the distribution logic.

### Root Cause

Integer division rounding and “≥1 user” rules not symmetrically applied.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Total staker count < 5, or multiple simultaneous stakes/unstakes.

### External Pre-conditions

A burst of new stakers or mass withdrawals.

### Attack Path

Tier boundary recalculation incorrectly assigns more or fewer slots, allowing some users to occupy higher tiers unfairly.

### Impact

Medium: mis-reward allocation, user dissatisfaction, and governance disputes.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

• Write unit tests for low‐count scenarios.
• Use “ceil” or “floor” consistently and cap at min/max slot counts explicitly.
