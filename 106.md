# [Medium] Users lose earned rewards when dropping below minStakeAmount via unstake (LayerEdgeStaking::_unstake)

### Summary

Missing reward checkpointing before tier demotion will cause a permanent reward loss for users as unstaking below `minStakeAmount` will retroactively change their reward tier without preserving prior accrual, leading to incorrect interest calculation.

### Root Cause

In [LayerEdgeStaking.sol::_unstake](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L725-755), the contract changes a user’s tier to Tier 3 if their balance drops below `minStakeAmount`, but does not call `_updateInterest()` before demoting the tier. This causes prior Tier 1 or Tier 2 interest to be wiped and incorrectly recalculated at the lower Tier 3 rate.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. [User needs to stake] an amount greater than or equal to `minStakeAmount` to enter Tier 1 or Tier 2.
2. [User needs to accumulate] unclaimed rewards over time without triggering an update.
3. [User needs to unstake] an amount that causes their `balance < minStakeAmount`, triggering the `outOfTree` demotion path.

### External Pre-conditions

None required. The attack is entirely self-executed and internal to the contract logic.

### Attack Path

1. Alice stakes 3,100 tokens (just above the `minStakeAmount` of 3,000) and enters Tier 1.
2. She waits 30 days, earning high Tier 1 APY.
3. She unstakes 300 tokens, reducing her balance to 2,800 (below `minStakeAmount`), triggering a permanent downgrade to Tier 3.
4. Because `_updateInterest()` is not called before this demotion, her accrued Tier 1 interest is lost.
5. She waits another 30 days, then claims interest.
6. The contract calculates all 60 days of rewards at Tier 3 APY, despite 30 days being earned under Tier 1.

### Impact

The user permanently loses earned interest. In the demonstrated test case, Alice loses ~175 tokens in unclaimed Tier 1 rewards.

This results in direct economic harm and undermines trust in the tier-based reward system. The issue is particularly damaging for long-term stakers who are demoted near the end of their staking period.

### PoC

This Foundry test shows Alice stakes just above the minimum, then unstakes enough to trigger a tier downgrade. Her accrued Tier 1 interest is lost, and her final interest payout is `0` despite 60 days of active staking.

Alice received zero tokens despite having ~175 tokens in accrued rewards before demotion.

### Mitigation

Ensure `_updateInterest(userAddr)` is called before any tier demotion due to balance changes.

```solidity
function _unstake(uint256 amount, address userAddr) internal {
    UserInfo storage user = users[userAddr];

    require(user.balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    _updateInterest(userAddr); // Already present here

    ...

    if (!user.outOfTree && user.balance < minStakeAmount) {
+       _updateInterest(userAddr); // Add this again here BEFORE tier drop
        _recordTierChange(userAddr, Tier.Tier3);
        ...
    }
}
```

This ensures that interest earned in a higher tier is properly snapshotted before the user is demoted to Tier 3, preserving accuracy and user trust.
