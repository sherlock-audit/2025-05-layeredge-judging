# Native-token functions assume WETH interface although the spec says “EDGEN on Ethereum”

### Summary

The README states: “On Ethereum, we use EDGEN, an Open­Zeppelin ERC20Permit token. On LayerEdge, we use the WETH9 contract.”
Yet stakeNative, claimInterestNative, completeUnstakeNative and the contracts receive() handler hard-code the WETH9 interface (deposit()/withdraw()`).
If the contract is initialised with EDGEN (the Ethereum deployment scenario the spec asks us to test) every call to one of the Native functions reverts and ETH supplied by users becomes permanently stuck in the contract.

### Root Cause

In LayerEdgeStaking.sol:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L686C9-L686C67

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L771

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L801

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L121C1-L121C89

```solidity
// stakeNative
IWETH(address(stakingToken)).deposit{value: amount}();   // assumes WETH

// claimInterestNative / completeUnstakeNative
IWETH(address(stakingToken)).withdraw(amount);
and

receive() external payable {
    require(msg.sender == address(stakingToken), "Only staking token can send ETH");
}

```
If stakingToken is not a WETH-compatible contract (e.g. EDGEN),
• deposit() / withdraw() do not exist → immediate revert;
• ETH sent directly to stakeNative is accepted by the EVM before
the call reverts, so the ETH is locked.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Admin deploys / initialises LayerEdgeStaking on Ethereum with stakingToken = address(EDGEN) as specified in the README.
A user calls any of – stakeNative() – claimInterestNative() – completeUnstakeNative() or simply sends ETH to the contract address.

### External Pre-conditions

None – no external protocol interaction required.

### Attack Path

User calls stakeNative() and supplies 1 ETH.
Function reaches IWETH(address(stakingToken)).deposit{value:1}(); which reverts (deposit() not found on EDGEN).
The ETH has already been transferred to the contract (call-data is processed after the value transfer), so it is now unrecoverable.
Every subsequent Native call from any user reverts for the same reason; non-native paths continue to work, but ETH remains trapped.

### Impact

Users lose whatever ETH they attempted to stake; contract’s native-token
interface is unusable on the Ethereum deployment envisaged by the
specification

### PoC

function test_nativeStakeWithEdgenReverts() public {
    // initialise staking with EDGEN (an ERC-20 without deposit()/withdraw())
    staking.initialize(address(edgen), admin);

    vm.deal(alice, 1 ether);
    vm.prank(alice);
    vm.expectRevert();                    // deposit() selector missing
    staking.stakeNative{value: 1 ether}();

    // ETH locked inside contract balance
    assertEq(address(staking).balance, 1 ether);
}

### Mitigation

Add an isWETH flag during initialize():
```solidity
bool public isWETH;

function initialize(address _token, address _admin, bool _isWETH) public initializer {
    isWETH = _isWETH;
    ...
}
```
and guard every Native function:

```solidity
require(isWETH, "Native staking disabled");
```
Deploy with isWETH = false on Ethereum / EDGEN, true on LayerEdge.
