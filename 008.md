# Precision Loss in Reward Calculations Description

The calculateReward function (lines 141–154) calculates rewards based on the staked amount, duration, and reward rate. The formula is:
solidity

uint256 reward = (stakedAmount * rewardRate * duration * bonusMultiplier) / (block.timestamp - startTime) / 1e18;

The division by (block.timestamp - startTime) and 1e18 can lead to significant precision loss, especially for small values of duration or early in the contract’s lifecycle when block.timestamp - startTime is small. Integer division in Solidity truncates decimal results, potentially reducing rewards to zero or unfairly low values for early stakers, undermining the FCFS reward model.
Impact: Users may receive significantly lower rewards than expected, especially early in the staking period, which could lead to loss of trust or financial loss. This is critical given the FCFS model’s emphasis on rewarding early stakers.
Recommendation:
Reorder operations to minimize precision loss (e.g., perform multiplications before divisions).

Use a higher precision denominator or a library like OpenZeppelin’s Math for safe arithmetic.

Consider a minimum duration check to avoid division by small numbers.

Example fix:
solidity

uint256 reward = (stakedAmount * rewardRate * duration * bonusMultiplier) / 1e18 / Math.max(block.timestamp - startTime, 1);
