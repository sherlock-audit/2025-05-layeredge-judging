# Staker at the boundary rank will receive fewer rewards in edge case

### Summary
Staker at the boundary rank will receive fewer rewards in some case, since their tier is not upgraded to upper tier.

### Root Cause
To better understand this problem, consider the following scenario:

- The total number of stakers in the tree (`stakerCountInTree`) is currently 24.
- The counts of stakers in Tier 1 is 4, and in Tier 2 is 7.
- A user tries to stake more than `minStakeAmount`.

This staking triggers the `_checkBoundariesAndRecord(false)` function call inside the [`_stake()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L712).

```solidity
    function _stake(uint256 amount, address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
        ...

        if (!user.isActive && amount >= minStakeAmount) {
            user.joinId = nextJoinId++;
            stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1);
            stakerAddress[user.joinId] = userAddr;
            user.isActive = true;
            stakerCountInTree++;

            uint256 rank = stakerTree.query(user.joinId);
            tier = _computeTierByRank(rank, stakerCountInTree);
            user.isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake = true;

            _recordTierChange(userAddr, tier);
>>>         _checkBoundariesAndRecord(false);
        }

        ...
    }
```

After this staking process:
- The total number of stakers in the tree increases to 25.
- The counts for tiers are now: tier1 = 5, tier2 = 7.

Given the new counts, logically:
- The user who was at rank 5 should now be upgraded to Tier 1.
- The user at rank 12 should be upgraded to Tier 2.

However, current implementation of the function `_checkBoundariesAndRecord()` only updates rank of `old_t1 + old_t2`, which is 4 + 7 = 11. The staker who at the rank of 11 have already been assigned to tier2 and nothing will be updated. On the other hand, staker who at the rank of 12 won't be upgraded to tier2 and receive fewer rewards.

```solidity
    function _checkBoundariesAndRecord(bool isRemoval) internal {
        ...

        // Tier 2 boundary handling
        if (new_t1 + new_t2 > 0) {
            if (new_t2 != old_t2) {
                // Need to update all users between the old and new tier 2 boundaries
                uint256 old_boundary = old_t1 + old_t2;
                uint256 new_boundary = new_t1 + new_t2;

                if (new_boundary > old_boundary) {
                    // Promotion case: update all users from old_boundary+1 to new_boundary
                    for (uint256 rank = old_boundary + 1; rank <= new_boundary; rank++) {
                        _findAndRecordTierChange(rank, n);
                    }
                } else {
                    // Demotion case: update all users from new_boundary+1 to old_boundary
                    for (uint256 rank = new_boundary + 1; rank <= old_boundary; rank++) {
                        _findAndRecordTierChange(rank, n);
                    }
                }
            }
            // Handle case where Tier 2 count stays the same
            else if (isRemoval) {
                _findAndRecordTierChange(new_t1 + new_t2, n);
            } else if (!isRemoval) {
>>>             _findAndRecordTierChange(old_t1 + old_t2, n);
            }
        }
    }
```

### Internal Preconditions
The issue occurs in the context where `stakerCountInTree` has just increasedâ€”for example, from 24 to 25.

### External Preconditions
None

### Attack Path
None

### Impact
Staker at the boundary will receive fewer rewards than real, due to udpate of incorrect rank.

### Proof of Concept
None

### Mitigation Strategy
Update `_checkBoundariesAndRecord()` so that it compares `old_boundary` and `new_boundary` not `new_t2` and `old_t2`, when `new_t1 + new_t2 > 0`.
