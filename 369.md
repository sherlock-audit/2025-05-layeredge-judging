# Tier Manipulation via Zero `minStakeAmount`

 

### Summary

A critical vulnerability exists within the `LayerEdgeStaking.sol` contract that allows for the manipulation of its tiered reward system. By leveraging the owner's ability to set `minStakeAmount` to zero, malicious or opportunistic users can create "ghost" staker entries. These ghost stakers, despite having no active stake, continue to occupy positions within the Fenwick tree (`stakerTree`) used for tier determination. This artificially inflates `stakerCountInTree`, skews tier assignments, and disadvantages legitimate stakers by pushing them into lower, less lucrative APY tiers. The First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) principle of the tier system is thereby undermined.

### Root Cause Analysis

The vulnerability originates in the `_unstake` function, specifically within the conditional logic designed to remove users from the `stakerTree` if their balance falls below the `minStakeAmount`:

```solidity
// LayerEdgeStaking.sol, _unstake function, relevant lines:
// ...
        if (!user.outOfTree && user.balance < minStakeAmount) {
            _recordTierChange(userAddr, Tier.Tier3);
            stakerTree.update(user.joinId, -1);
            stakerCountInTree--;
            user.outOfTree = true;
            stakerCountOutOfTree++;
            _checkBoundariesAndRecord(true);
        }
// ...
```

If the contract owner sets `minStakeAmount` to `0` (via `setMinStakeAmount(0)`), the condition `user.balance < minStakeAmount` evaluates to `user.balance < 0`. Since `user.balance` is a `uint256` and cannot be negative, this condition will *always* be false.

Consequently, a user who unstakes their entire balance (resulting in `user.balance == 0`) will not trigger this block of code. They will:
1.  Not be marked as `outOfTree`.
2.  Not have their entry removed from the `stakerTree` (i.e., `stakerTree.update(user.joinId, -1)` is not called).
3.  Not lead to a decrement in `stakerCountInTree`.

Such users persist as "ghosts" in the tree, contributing to the `stakerCountInTree` and influencing tier calculations via `getCurrentTier`, despite holding no stake. The `getCurrentTier` function also fails to relegate these zero-balance users to Tier 3 because the `user.isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake` flag would have been set to `true` during their initial stake (when `minStakeAmount` was 0), and their `user.outOfTree` flag remains `false`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.  The contract owner (admin) must invoke `setMinStakeAmount(0)`, setting the minimum staking threshold to zero.
2.  At least one user (referred to as `stakerA` in the PoC) must call `stake()` with a non-zero amount while `minStakeAmount` is zero. This action adds them to the `stakerTree` and sets `users[stakerA].isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake = true`.
3.  The same user (`stakerA`) must subsequently call `unstake()` for their entire staked amount, reducing `users[stakerA].balance` to zero.

### External Pre-conditions

No specific external pre-conditions beyond standard blockchain network operation are required for this vulnerability.

### Attack Path Demonstration

1.  **Admin Action:** The contract owner calls `setMinStakeAmount(0)`.
2.  **Ghost Staker Creation (stakerA):**
    *   `stakerA` approves the staking contract for `X` tokens.
    *   `stakerA` calls `stake(X_amount)`.
        *   `stakerA` is added to `stakerTree`.
        *   `stakerCountInTree` increments.
        *   `users[stakerA].outOfTree` is `false`.
        *   `users[stakerA].isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake` is `true` (because `X_amount >= minStakeAmount` (0)).
    *   `stakerA` calls `unstake(X_amount)`.
        *   `users[stakerA].balance` becomes `0`.
        *   Crucially, due to the root cause, the condition `!user.outOfTree && user.balance < minStakeAmount` (evaluating to `!false && 0 < 0`) is `false`.
        *   `stakerA` is *not* removed from `stakerTree`.
        *   `stakerCountInTree` remains unchanged.
        *   `users[stakerA].outOfTree` remains `false`.
3.  **Legitimate Staker Entry (stakerB):**
    *   A new, genuine staker, `stakerB`, approves the contract for `Y` tokens.
    *   `stakerB` calls `stake(Y_amount)`.
        *   `stakerB` is added to `stakerTree`.
        *   `stakerCountInTree` increments.
4.  **Tier Calculation Skew:**
    *   When `getCurrentTier(stakerB)` is invoked, the `stakerCountInTree` used in `_computeTierByRank` includes the ghost staker (`stakerA`).
    *   `stakerA` (rank 1, balance 0) occupies a numerically superior position in the tree, potentially securing a Tier 1 slot based on the Fenwick tree query of its `joinId`.
    *   `stakerB` (rank 2, with actual stake `Y`) is consequently pushed to a lower tier (e.g., Tier 2 or Tier 3) than they would have achieved if `stakerA` had been correctly pruned from the tree.

### Impact Assessment

The primary impact is the **unfair distortion of the tier-based reward system**, leading to:

*   **Economic Disadvantage for Legitimate Stakers:** Genuine stakers may receive significantly lower APY rates than merited because "ghost" stakers consume higher-tier slots. This directly affects their expected returns.
*   **Erosion of FCFS Principle:** The intended "first-come-first-serve" nature of tier allocation is compromised. Early positions can be indefinitely held by zero-balance accounts.
*   **Inaccurate Staking Metrics:** `stakerCountInTree` becomes a misleading indicator of truly active and eligible stakers, potentially misinforming users and airdrop/bonus distributors relying on this data.
*   **Loss of Trust:** The perceived fairness and integrity of the staking mechanism are undermined, potentially discouraging participation.

}

### Recommended Mitigation Strategies

Two primary approaches can address this vulnerability:

1.  **Prevent `minStakeAmount` from being zero (Recommended):**
    Modify the `setMinStakeAmount` function to ensure the amount is always greater than zero. This is the simplest and most direct fix.
    ```diff
    // LayerEdgeStaking.sol
    function setMinStakeAmount(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    +   require(amount > 0, "Min stake amount must be greater than zero");
        minStakeAmount = amount;
    }
    ```

2.  **Adjust `_unstake` Logic for Zero Balance Removal:**
    If setting `minStakeAmount` to zero is a desired operational feature (though this seems counterintuitive for its purpose), the `_unstake` logic must be enhanced to explicitly handle cases where a user's balance becomes zero, regardless of the `minStakeAmount` value.
    ```diff
    // LayerEdgeStaking.sol
    function _unstake(uint256 amount, address userAddr) internal {
        // ... (existing code before the conditional removal) ...

    -   if (!user.outOfTree && user.balance < minStakeAmount) {
    +   // User should be removed if they are not already out of tree AND
    +   // (their balance is now zero OR (minStakeAmount is positive AND their balance is below it))
    +   if (!user.outOfTree && (user.balance == 0 || (minStakeAmount > 0 && user.balance < minStakeAmount))) {
            _recordTierChange(userAddr, Tier.Tier3);
            stakerTree.update(user.joinId, -1);
            stakerCountInTree--;
            user.outOfTree = true;
            stakerCountOutOfTree++;
            _checkBoundariesAndRecord(true);
        }

        // ... (rest of the function) ...
    }
    ```
    Additionally, ensure `users[userAddr].isActive` is set to `false` if `users[userAddr].balance` becomes `0` after unstaking, to correctly reflect their status in functions like `getCurrentTier`. This might involve adding:
    ```solidity
    if (user.balance == 0) {
        user.isActive = false; // Ensure user is marked inactive if balance is zero
    }
    ```
    within the `_unstake` function after the balance update.

**Preference:** The first mitigation (enforcing `minStakeAmount > 0`) is strongly recommended due to its simplicity and for maintaining the clear intent of `minStakeAmount` as a non-zero threshold. Allowing `minStakeAmount = 0` complicates the logic and the conceptual model of minimum stake requirements.
