# All acquired interest are lost when compounding is enabled in `LayerEdgeStaking.sol`.

### Summary

The `LayerEdgeStaking.sol` contract has a functionality to compound interest for the users who staked in the protocol at the control of the admin.If the admin decides to enable compounding, he can using the `setCompoundingStatus()` function.when the compounding is enabled a user who staked in the protocol can enable it by calling the function `compoundInterest()`.But when he does so,All the acquired interest that the user received from the day he started staking is lost. This is because the function resets the `interestEarned` by the user to `0` before transferring the already acquired interest to the user.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L233

The main problem is the function `compoundInterest()`.

```solidity
    function compoundInterest() external whenCompoundingEnabled nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
            _updateInterest(msg.sender);

        UserInfo storage user = users[msg.sender];
        uint256 claimable = user.interestEarned;

        require(claimable > 0, "Nothing to compound");

        // Check if we have enough rewards in the contract
        require(rewardsReserve >= claimable, "Insufficient rewards in contract");

        // Update rewards reserve
        rewardsReserve -= claimable;

        // Add earned interest to staked balance
        user.balance += claimable;
        totalStaked += claimable;

        // Reset interest tracking
        user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;
        //@audit issue
@>        user.interestEarned = 0;
        user.totalClaimed += claimable;

        // Determine user's tier for event (might have changed due to increased balance)
        Tier tier = getCurrentTier(msg.sender);

        emit RewardClaimed(msg.sender, claimable);
        emit Staked(msg.sender, claimable, tier);

    }
```  
we can see in this function that when the compounding is enabled, the user's interest earned is set to 0 without transferring the user's acquired interest this means that all the acquired interest gained by the user from the day he started staking is lost.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. user need to stake in the protocol
2. compounding should be enabled by the admin
3. user should enable compounding before claiming interest.

### External Pre-conditions

Nil

### Attack Path

Nil

### Impact

The impact is High because all the acquired interest the day a user started staking is lost when compounding is enabled by the admin. This means loss of funds to the user.

### PoC

paste this test file in the `LayerEdgeStakingTest.t.sol` then run `forge test --mt test_allAcquiredInterestLostAfterCompound`

```solidity 
    function test_allAcquiredInterestLostAfterCompound() external {
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE);
        staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 7 days);
        staking.compoundInterest();
        vm.expectRevert("Nothing to claim");
        staking.claimInterest();
    }
```
we can see from the test that, the user starts gaining interest for a period of 7 days after staking in the contract, but when compounding is enabled by the user he cant claim his interest because there is no interest left to claim.

This test shows how much of acquired interest is lost by staking for 7 days. run this test `forge test --mt test_allAcquiredInterestAmount -vv`

```solidity
    function test_allAcquiredInterestAmount() external {
        //for this test i have set the initial token balance of alice to MIN_STAKE for easier calculation
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE);
        staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
        console2.log("Alice token balance after staking :", token.balanceOf(alice));
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 7 days);
        staking.claimInterest();
        console2.log("acquired interest:", token.balanceOf(alice));
    }
```

```
Alice lost all of the acquired interest of `28767123287671232876` tokens as a result of this.

### Mitigation

when a user calls the `compoundInterest()`function, send the previous acquired interest to the user before setting the interest rate to 0.
