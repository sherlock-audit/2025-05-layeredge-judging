# getTierCountForStakerCount() does not calculate correctly staker amount for each tier

### Summary

getTierCountForStakerCount() function expects to tell the amount of stakers in each tier for a total amount of stakers. According to readme, this will be 20% for tier1, 30% for tier2 and 50% for tier3, however in some cases the function will tell that tier3 should have more users than expected.

### Root Cause

The possible mistake is due to the rounding down of solidity in decimal numbers combined with the way used by the function. According to the function, to calculate Tier1 and 2 it is done respectively:
 `totalStakers * 20 / 100 `  and  `totalStakers * 30 / 100 `. The remaining amount of users will directly go to Tier3, but this is clearly an error in some situations. Think of the case of totalStakers = 12.

Tier1 = 12 * 20 / 100 = 2.4 = 2;
Tier2 = 12 * 30 / 100 = 3.6 = 3;
Tier3 = 12 - 2 - 3 = 7

Even if Tier3 is expected to have 50% of 12 = 6 stakers, it has 7. So that there one user that should go in Tier2 is put into Tier3, making him receive less rewards than expected.

### Impact

A user that should go in Tier2 is put in Tier3, receiving a lower APY for all the time that he stays in that Tier. The system fails to properly handle the expected Tier distribution (20% for Tier1, 30% for Tier2, 50% for Tier3).


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the getTierCountForStakerCount() function so that it properly returns the amount of stakers per tier. Instead of calculating 20% for Tier1 and 30% for Tier2 separately (which would make the error bigger are this is 2 numbers being rounded down), calculate Tier2 as `50% of all users minus amount of users in Tier1`:

```solidity
function getTierCountForStakerCount(uint256 stakerCount)
        public
        pure
        returns (uint256 tier1Count, uint256 tier2Count, uint256 tier3Count)
    {
        // Calculate tier 1 count (20% of active stakers)
        tier1Count = (stakerCount * TIER1_PERCENTAGE) / 100;

        // Ensure at least 1 staker in tier 1 if there are any active stakers
        if (tier1Count == 0 && stakerCount > 0) {
            tier1Count = 1;
        }

        // Calculate remaining stakers after tier 1
        uint256 remainingAfterTier1 = stakerCount > tier1Count ? stakerCount - tier1Count : 0;

        // Calculate tier 2 count (30% of total active stakers, but don't exceed remaining)
-       uint256 calculatedTier2Count = (stakerCount * TIER2_PERCENTAGE) / 100;
+      uint256 calculatedTier2Count = (stakerCount * (TIER2_PERCENTAGE + TIER1_PERCENTAGE) / 100 - tier1Count;

        if (calculatedTier2Count == 0 && remainingAfterTier1 > 0) {
            tier2Count = 1;
        } else {
            tier2Count = calculatedTier2Count > remainingAfterTier1 ? remainingAfterTier1 : calculatedTier2Count;
        }

        // Tier 3 is everyone else
        tier3Count = stakerCount > (tier1Count + tier2Count) ? stakerCount - tier1Count - tier2Count : 0;

        return (tier1Count, tier2Count, tier3Count);
    }
```
