# A user who is at permanently on Tier3, moved into Tier2 which should not be

## Vulnerability Details
From the protocol logic, we see that if a user, let's say Bob, [unstakes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L743) which is below `minStakeAmount`, he remains in Tier 3 permanently, even though he added more tokens later.

But he will be promoted to Tier 2 on the condition that his position is moved because of the new user being added.

From [doc -> LayerEdgeStaking.md](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/docs/LayerEdgeStaking.md#example-2-user-joining-causes-tier-promotion)

#### Example 2: User Joining Causes Tier Promotion

```Text
           Before: 5 users                    After: 7 users
┌────────┬────────┬────────────┐   ┌────────┬────────┬────────────┐
│ Tier 1 │ Tier 2 │   Tier 3   │   │ Tier 1 │ Tier 2 │   Tier 3   │
│(1 user) │(1 user) │(3 users)  │   │(1 user) │(2 users)│(4 users)  │
└────────┴────────┴────────────┘   └────────┴────────┴────────────┘
   1       2         3  4  5         1        2  3      4  5  6  7
                                                 ↑
                                            User #3
                                        moves from Tier 3
                                            to Tier 2
```

In this example:
- With 5 users, the tier calculation works out to:
  - Tier 1: 20% of 5 = 1 user (User #-1)
  - Tier 2: 30% of 5 = 1.5, rounded down to 1 user (User #-2)
  - Tier 3: Remaining 3 users (Users #-3, #-4, #-5)
- When both User #-6 and User #-7 join, the tier boundaries shift:
  - Tier 1: 20% of 7 = 1.4, rounded down to 1 user
  - Tier 2: 30% of 7 = 2.1, rounded down to 2 users
  - Tier 3: Remaining 4 users
- This causes:
  - User #-1 remains in Tier 1
  - User #-2 remains in Tier 2
  - User #-3 moves from Tier 3 to Tier 2 (promotion)
  - Users #-4 and #-5 remain in Tier 3
  - Users #-6 and #-7 join as Tier 3


## Impact

So similar to that, when the user Bob will be in this kind of position, he will be moved to Tier 2, which breaks protocol invariants.
As Bob unstakes, which is below `minStakeAmount`, he should remains in Tier 3 permanently

Not necessary he will be in number 3 position, and the total number of users will be 7.
He could be in such a position where he will be moved to Tier 2, and the total user may be more than that.

What I want to say is that because of the total user and recalculating logic, the user who is in Tier 3 will be moved to Tier 2

And the protocol logic does not check if the person is permanently Tier 3 or not

On the [doc](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/README.md#q-what-propertiesinvariants-do-you-want-to-hold-even-if-breaking-them-has-a-lowunknown-impact) it says
#### Q: What properties/invariants do you want to hold even if breaking them has a low/unknown impact?
5. Permanent tier demotion: Users who unstake below minStakeAmount should permanently remain in Tier 3(Out of tree/system)

## Recommendation 

Implement a logic that checks if a user is in the permanent Tier3 or not.

You can introduce a new variable on the `UserInfo` where it will declare if the user is in the permanent Tier3 or not.
And based on that, he will not be promoted to a higher Tier after recalculation when he falls into that condition.
