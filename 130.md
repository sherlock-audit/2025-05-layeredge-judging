# Possible Underflow Error in Fenwick Tree Due to Explicit Integer Cast Leading to Data Corruption and Potential Denial of Service

### Summary

An **explicit integer cast `uint256(int256(...) + delta)` in the [Fenwick Tree's update function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/library/FenwickTree.sol#L10-L17)** will cause **internal data corruption** for the **Fenwick Tree library's state**, as **any calling contract (like LayerEdgeStaking) that attempts to decrement a Fenwick Tree node already at zero** will **cause the node's value to underflow and wrap around to an extremely large positive number, leading to incorrect query results and potential Denial of Service (DoS) for consuming applications.**


### Root Cause


In `FenwickTree.sol:update`, the line `self.data[index] = uint256(int256(self.data[index]) + delta);` explicitly casts `self.data[index]` (a `uint256`) to `int256`, performs the addition with `delta` (which can be negative), and then casts the result back to `uint256`. This design choice allows intermediate negative values (e.g., `int256(0) + int256(-1)` results in `int256(-1)`) to wrap around to `2^256 - 1` when converted back to `uint256`. This effectively bypasses Solidity's default `uint256` underflow protection (present in 0.8.0+), leading to silent data corruption within the `FenwickTree.data` array.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. **`FenwickTree.data[index]`** for a specific internal node must be exactly `0` when `FenwickTree.update` is called.
2. The `delta` value passed to `FenwickTree.update` must be negative (e.g., `int256(-1)`).

### External Pre-conditions

1. **`LayerEdgeStaking.stakerCountInTree`** needs to change (e.g., a user unstakes) to trigger `LayerEdgeStaking._checkBoundariesAndRecord`.
2. **`LayerEdgeStaking._findAndRecordTierChange` (or its underlying rank management logic)** needs to attempt to decrement a rank in the Fenwick Tree that has already been decremented or is logically empty, thus causing the `FenwickTree.update(index, delta)` call with `delta = -1` on a `FenwickTree.data[index]` that is `0`. This typically occurs due to complex rank-shifting logic or redundant `update` calls.

### Attack Path

This is a **data corruption and logic bypass vulnerability path** primarily impacting the `FenwickTree`'s integrity, leading to issues in `LayerEdgeStaking`.

1. **Initial Stable State:**
    
    - The `LayerEdgeStaking` contract has several active stakers, and its internal Fenwick Tree (`ft.data`) accurately reflects their ranks and counts.
    - Due to previous valid operations, some internal nodes `ft.data[index]` (representing sums of specific rank segments) are `0`.
2. **Triggering Action in `LayerEdgeStaking`:**
    
    - A user (e.g., "Dave") calls `LayerEdgeStaking._unstake()`.
    - This action causes `LayerEdgeStaking.stakerCountInTree` to decrement.
    - `LayerEdgeStaking._unstake` calls `_checkBoundariesAndRecord(true)`.
3. **`_checkBoundariesAndRecord` Re-evaluation:**
    
    - `_checkBoundariesAndRecord` recalculates tier boundaries and enters loops (e.g., demotion loops) to identify users whose tiers might have changed.
    - Within these loops, it calls `_findAndRecordTierChange(rank, new_n)` for affected ranks.

4. **Fenwick Tree Data Corruption:**
    
    - The `FenwickTree.update(idx, -1)` function is called.
    - Inside `FenwickTree.update`, the loop reaches `self.data[idx]`.
    - At this point, `self.data[idx]` (a `uint256`) is `0`, and `delta` is `int256(-1)`.
    - The line `self.data[idx] = uint256(int256(self.data[idx]) + delta);` executes.
    - `int256(0) + int256(-1)` results in `int256(-1)`.
    - `uint256(int256(-1))` converts to `2^256 - 1`.
    - **Result: `self.data[idx]` within the Fenwick Tree's internal `data` array is corrupted, becoming `2^256 - 1`.**
6. **Consequences in `LayerEdgeStaking`:**
    
    - When `LayerEdgeStaking` subsequently calls `FenwickTree.findByCumulativeFrequency` or other query functions on the corrupted tree:
        - `findByCumulativeFrequency` might return `0` for `joinId`s, causing `LayerEdgeStaking` to try and process `address(0)` as a user (e.g., updating `stakerTierHistory[address(0)]`).
        - In some specific scenarios, the extremely large corrupted `uint256` values within `ft.data` can cause `findByCumulativeFrequency`'s internal loops to become computationally expensive or infinite, leading to **Out-Of-Gas (OOG) errors** and a **Denial of Service (DoS)** for subsequent `LayerEdgeStaking` transactions that depend on the Fenwick Tree.


### Impact

The **Fenwick Tree library's internal state** suffers **critical data corruption**. This directly impacts the **LayerEdgeStaking protocol** as it relies on the Fenwick Tree for accurate rank-based tiering. **Users** might experience **incorrect tier assignments** and potentially **wrong APY calculations** due to faulty rank lookups. Furthermore, the corrupted Fenwick Tree can lead to a **Denial of Service (DoS)** for any future `LayerEdgeStaking` transactions that query the tree (e.g., staking, unstaking, claiming rewards), as these operations may exhaust gas due to computations on corrupted data.

### PoC


1. **Initial Setup:** Several users (Alice, Bob, Charlie) stake tokens in `LayerEdgeStaking`. The Fenwick Tree (`ft.data`) accurately reflects their ranks. Due to previous operations, some internal `ft.data[index]` nodes might be `0` (representing empty segments).
    
2. **The Trigger - A Key Unstake:**
    
    - A user (e.g., Dave) **unstakes their tokens**.
    - This causes `stakerCountInTree` to decrease, triggering `LayerEdgeStaking._checkBoundariesAndRecord()`.
    - `LayerEdgeStaking`'s logic correctly removes Dave's old rank from the Fenwick Tree.
3. **The Corruption (The Bug in Action):**
    
    - **Crucially, due to a logical flaw in `LayerEdgeStaking`'s rank management** (specifically during the tier re-evaluation in `_checkBoundariesAndRecord`), the contract **mistakenly makes a redundant call** to `ft.update(some_idx, -1)`. This `some_idx` refers to an internal Fenwick Tree node (`ft.data[some_idx]`) that has _already been correctly set to `0`_ by an earlier valid operation.
    - When `ft.update(some_idx, -1)` is executed:
        - It attempts `uint256(int256(0) + (-1))`.
        - The `int256(-1)` wraps around, corrupting `ft.data[some_idx]` to `2^256 - 1`.
4. **Demonstrating Impact:**
    
    - Any subsequent `LayerEdgeStaking` operation that queries the Fenwick Tree (e.g., `findByCumulativeFrequency` to get user ranks) will encounter this corrupted `2^256 - 1` value.
    - This leads to `findByCumulativeFrequency` returning **incorrect values (often `0`)**.
    - As a result, `LayerEdgeStaking` may attempt to process **`address(0)` as a user**, leading to **incorrect tier assignments, state pollution, and invalid event emissions.**
    - In some cases, the corrupted large values can also cause **infinite loops** in Fenwick Tree queries, leading to **Out-Of-Gas (OOG) errors and Denial of Service (DoS)** for users.


### Mitigation

Implement a `require` statement to explicitly prevent the wrapping behavior in `FenwickTree.update` when casting from `int256` to `uint256`.
