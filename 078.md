# Missing gap could lead to storage collision in future

### Summary

The `LayerEdgeStaking` contract is intended to be upgradeable. However, it does not have a __gap variable.

In upgradeable contracts, it's crucial to include a __gap to ensure that any additional storage variables added in future contract upgrades do not collide with existing storage variables.


### Root Cause

In `LayerEdgeStaking.sol`, there lacks a __gap variable.
Consider adding one here:

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contracts needs to have a __gap variable

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

 Insufficient storage space in the base may cause storage collisions when attempting to upgrade the contracts to its next version.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Recommend adding appropriate storage gap at the end of upgradeable contracts such as the below. Please reference the OpenZeppelin upgradeable contract templates.

```solidity
uint256[50] private __gap;  // Reserve slots for future use
```
