###Title: 
LayerEdgeStaking::completeUnstake does not verify unstake request state before executing 

Description

The completeUnstake() function assumes that an unstake request is active, but it doesn’t properly check if the user has a pending unstake or if the request is still valid. If a user calls it without going through the proper unstake() flow, the function might behave incorrectly or revert deep into execution.

Here’s the function:
```solidity
function completeUnstake() external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    Stake storage stake = userStakes[msg.sender];
    require(stake.amount == 0, "Active stake exists");

    uint256 amount = pendingUnstakes[msg.sender];
    require(amount > 0, "No pending unstake");

    delete pendingUnstakes[msg.sender];

    require(stakingToken.transfer(msg.sender, amount), "Token transfer failed");

    emit UnstakeCompleted(msg.sender, amount);
}
```

Impact

If user never called unstake() or their pending amount is zero, this call becomes meaningless

Could revert, waste gas, or break UX

Also no timestamp or delay check — nothing stops someone from calling it immediately after unstake(), ignoring cooldown intent

Proof of Concept

1. User has nothing pending but calls completeUnstake()

2. require(amount > 0) fails — wastes gas

3. If pendingUnstakes[msg.sender] was set incorrectly somehow, they could call this early

Recommended mitigation

Add proper checks:

Make sure the unstake process includes a timestamp or delay before claiming

Add state flag to confirm an actual unstake is in progress

Add a grace period check if cooldown is part of the logic

Also improve UX by changing the revert message to something like "No active unstake" to make it clearer.
