# Interest updating loops through the entire tier history, which is unbound.

### Summary

The staking mechanism of the `LayerEdgeStaking.sol` contract is a FCFS, meaning the only thing that matters is when you stake not how much, around which it bases it's APY tiers and moving users between those tiers.
When new users stake or old users unstake, the change in count affects users sitting at tier boundaries, which changes their APY. For these cases, the contract keeps track of a tier history array per user, which array is completely unbound and has the theoretical potential to be infinitely filled up.

### Root Cause

The place where the history array's size becomes problematic is `calculateUnclaimedInterest`, which is invoked in every user operations where interest is updated first:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L397-L468

The function loops the user's tier history to find out the tier he was in the last time he interacted, then it loops the rest of the tier history to calculate the yet to be claimed interest.

This looping over the history has the potential to hit OOG through careful crafting of stake/unstake operations from different addresses, which however could be very costly and has factors that cannot be estimated, most importantly the price of EDGEN.

The exploit is easiest explained through an example:
- In order for the victim participant, Alice, to suffer a permanent DOS on every operation she has to be sitting at a tier boundary.
- assuming 19 stakers, 9 before and 9 after Alice, she is sitting on the boundary between Tier2 and Tier3
- The 20th staker will cause her to cross boundaries when he stakes, when he unstakes it will cause her to go back to the original tier, adding 2 entries to her history
- for Alice's operations to be vulnerable to OOG, she would need ~1500-2000 entries in her history array due to wallet gas limitations. This is around 800-1000 stake/unstake operations since they add 2 entries to history
- These operations must be done by first time staker addresses, since every address is allowed participation only once, meaning 800-1000 addresses with 3000 EDGEN each (variable price, could be low cost, could be high cost)
- Every stake/unstake operation done atomically via a smart contract cost around 400k gas, meaning there would need to be multiple transactions containing batched stake/unstake operations executed from different addresses and would take 15-30 txs to complete and DOS Alice specifically, as well as the user sitting at the Tier1/Tier2 boundary

This entire process has a ton of prerequisites and a variable cost of ~5000$ of gas for all transactions + the cost of holding ~9mill EDGEN tokens. These EDGEN tokens can be later reclaimed after the period so the permanent cost is only the needed gas. All calculations are done in terms of ETH mainnet gas mechanics and prices.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None, however this attack affects only user sitting at tier boundaries. 
Times of less protocol activity would be perfect to avoid risk of internal transactions interfering with tiers.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Temporary acquisition of 9 mill EDGEN tokens
2. 800-1000 attacker or attacker group controlled tokens
3. Enough gas money to cover attackk
4. An external batching mechanism or flash-bot to secure ordering, due to the attack spanning multiple transactions  

### Attack Path

1. Alice is sitting on a tier boundary and any staking or unstaking would case her to shift tiers and add history entries
2. A dedicated attacker group or a singular wealthier attacker prepares 800-1000 addresses, from which they execute consecutive stake/unstake via flash bots and batching to minimize interference risk
3. Alice's tier history reaches ~2000 entries
4. Any attempt from Alice to interact with the protocol would cause her to loop all of her entries and hit OOG and get DOS'ed 

### Impact

The user suffers a permanent DOS and potentially the inability to claim their yield and locked stake

### PoC

The following POC cannot fully replicate the complex on-chain prerequisites like the multiple transaction filling of the history, however it can show how the history filling exponentially increases the gas cost of calculating Alice's unclaimed interest, which is the cause that leads to OOG:

### Mitigation

Either checkpoint tier history or cap the loop that happens during interest calculation.
