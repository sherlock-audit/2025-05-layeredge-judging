# Potential ERC-20 Token Compatibility Problem with "transferFrom"

The contract calls `stakingToken.transferFrom` and requires it to return true.

See the usage here:  
[LayerEdgeStaking.sol line 301](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol?plain=1#L301)

```solidity
require(stakingToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount), "Token transfer failed");
```

And at line 684: 

```solidity
require(stakingToken.transferFrom(userAddr, address(this), amount), "Token transfer failed");
```

Some ERC-20 tokens do not return a boolean on transferFrom, which can cause these calls to revert and break staking functionality for users with such tokens.

Impact: Users holding non-standard tokens may not be able to stake, resulting in denial of service.

Recommendation: Use OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeERC20 library to safely handle these token transfers.
