# Denial of Service  on Stake/Unstake Due to Unbounded Loops

### Summary

The [_checkBoundariesAndRecord](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L841-L900) internal function, called during staking and unstaking operations, contains unbounded for loops. These loops iterate over a range of rank values to update user tiers based on changes in the total `stakerCountInTree`. As the number of stakers (n) and the difference between old and new tier boundaries (new_t1 vs old_t1, new_t2 vs old_t2) increases, the number of iterations within these loops can become arbitrarily large. This can lead to the transaction exceeding the block gas limit, causing an "Out-of-Gas" error and effectively preventing users from staking or unstaking.
This will most likely happen because the protocol has a `MAX_USERS` of  100_000_000 which is a large number.

### Root Cause

Iterating in a loop when checking and updating user tiers

### Internal Pre-conditions

Presence of a large number of users

### External Pre-conditions

When user is staking the _checkBoundariesAndRecord function gets called to check and update boundaries

### Attack Path

1. The protocol has a large number of users eg 10,000,000 users
2. Block gas limit is set to 20M
3. On staking when the _checkBoundariesAndRecord function gets called it iterates in the loop untill it reaches block.gas limit and the transaction reverts
4. Staking and unstaking functionalities fail to work

### Impact

Denial of Service for the stake and unstake functionalities. 


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Instead of processing all tier changes within a single stake or unstake transaction, implement a separate, callable function (e.g., processTierUpdates(uint256 startRank, uint256 endRank)) that allows for batch processing of tier changes.
