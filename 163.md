# Permanent Lockout of Stakers in LayerEdgeStaking Contract

### Summary

The LayerEdgeStaking contract contains a critical vulnerability where users can become permanently locked out of the staking system in two scenarios: 

1. when they initially stake below the minimum amount, and 
2. when they fully unstake. 

This occurs due to improper handling of the `isActive` flag and tree participation status, preventing users from ever participating in the tier system or earning proper APY rates.


### Root Cause

The root cause lies in the `_stake` function's logic where the isActive flag is set to true on first stake but never reset, and the conditions for entering the staking tree `(!user.isActive && amount >= minStakeAmount)` can never be met again once a user has staked. Additionally, the `_unstake` function never resets the user's active status, permanently marking them as out of the tree system.

// In _unstake function
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L740-L749



### Internal Pre-conditions

- User must have staked below minStakeAmount at least once, OR
- User must have fully unstaked their tokens at least once

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

#### Scenario 1 - Initial Below Minimum Stake:

1. User stakes `amount < minStakeAmount`
2. `isActive` is set to true
3. outOfTree is set to true
4. User is counted in `stakerCountOutOfTree`
5. User can never enter the tree system even with larger stakes

#### Scenario 2 - Full Unstaking:

1. User stakes `amount >= minStakeAmount`
2. User is added to tree with joinId
3. User fully unstakes
4. `isActive` remains true
5. User can never re-enter the tree system

### Impact

High Severity: Users can become permanently locked out of the staking system
Financial Impact: Users cannot earn proper APY rates or participate in tier system
User Experience: Users must create new addresses to participate properly

### PoC

```solidity

// Initial below minimum stake
    function test_LayerEdgeStaking_PermanentLockoutBelowMinimum() public {
        
        address bereket = makeAddr("bereket");
        vm.prank(admin);
        token.transfer(bereket, MIN_STAKE * 2);

        // Setup
        uint256 belowMinStake = MIN_STAKE - 1;
        
        vm.startPrank(bereket);
        token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE * 10);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // First stake below minimum
        vm.prank(bereket);
        staking.stake(belowMinStake);

        // Try to stake above minimum
        vm.prank(bereket);
        staking.stake(MIN_STAKE + 1);


        // User still out of tree after staking an amount more than minimum stake
        assertEq(staking.stakerCountInTree(), 0);
        assertEq(staking.stakerCountOutOfTree(), 1);
    }

    // Full unstaking scenario
    function testPermanentLockoutAfterUnstake() public {

        address bereket = makeAddr("bereket");
        vm.prank(admin);
        token.transfer(bereket, MIN_STAKE * 10);

        // Setup
        uint256 aboveMinStake = MIN_STAKE + 1;
        
        vm.startPrank(bereket);
        token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE * 10);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // First stake above minimum
        vm.prank(bereket);
        staking.stake(aboveMinStake);
        
        // Fully unstake
        vm.prank(bereket);
        staking.unstake(aboveMinStake);
        
        // Try to stake again
        vm.prank(bereket);
        staking.stake(aboveMinStake);
        
        // User still out of tree after staking an amount more than minimum stake
        assertEq(staking.stakerCountInTree(), 0);
        assertEq(staking.stakerCountOutOfTree(), 1);
    }

```



### Mitigation

Reset `isActive` flag when user fully unstakes
