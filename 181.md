# Users can receive rewards for periods with no APY

### Summary

Users can receive rewards for periods with no APY

### Root Cause

The following code in `getTierAPYForPeriod()`:
```solidity
        if (startTime < apyPeriods[0].startTime) {
            startTime = apyPeriods[0].startTime;
            if (startTime >= endTime) return apyPeriods[0].rate;
        }
```
If the user has staked before the first APY period has started, we are pushing his `startTime` up to the start point of the first APY period. However, this results in the user's stake getting APY even before the first period was created.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The first APY period is not created immediately (so a user stakes before it is created), the code explicitly handles it, thus it is possible

### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

1. Let's imagine a period with an APY of 1e17 (10%, the code uses an extra precision of 100 which we will ignore here for simplicity)
2. The user stakes at time `T` and the first APY period is created at time `T + 7 days`
3. The user wants to claim his interest at time `T + 14 days` and as the period was created only 7 days ago, he must receive an APY for the last 7 days, not since his stake time
4. User's claim range is computed as follows where `user.lastClaimTime` is the time of the deposit or time `T` (this is in `calculateUnclaimedInterest()`:
```solidity
        uint256 fromTime = user.lastClaimTime;
        uint256 toTime = block.timestamp;
```
5. Then, we handle this code:
```solidity
        uint256 periodStart = fromTime;
        uint256 periodEnd;

        // First handle the tier the user was in at fromTime
        if (relevantStartIndex + 1 < userTierHistory.length && userTierHistory[relevantStartIndex + 1].timestamp < toTime) {
            periodEnd = userTierHistory[relevantStartIndex + 1].timestamp;
        } else {
            periodEnd = toTime;
        }
```
Here, `periodStart` will be the `fromTime` or time `T` and `periodEnd` will be `toTime` or the current timestamp (`T + 14 days`) as he only has one period in his tier history

6. We reach `getTierAPYForPeriod()` where we reach the problematic code:
```solidity
        if (startTime < apyPeriods[0].startTime) {
            startTime = apyPeriods[0].startTime;
            if (startTime >= endTime) return apyPeriods[0].rate;
        }
```
`startTime` is time `T` and the period's start time is `T + 7 days`, thus we go in the check and set `startTime` as `T + 7 days`

7. Then, we go in the period loop where we run 1 iteration with the following code:
```solidity
            uint256 periodStart = (period.startTime > startTime) ? period.startTime : startTime;

            // Period end is min of next period start and our endTime
            uint256 periodEnd;
            if (i < apyPeriods.length - 1) {
                periodEnd = (apyPeriods[i + 1].startTime < endTime) ? apyPeriods[i + 1].startTime : endTime;
            } else {
                periodEnd = endTime;
            }

            // Skip if period has no duration
            if (periodEnd <= periodStart) continue;

            // Calculate duration of this sub-period
            uint256 duration = periodEnd - periodStart;
            totalDuration += duration;

            // Add weighted contribution to sum
            weightedSum += period.rate * duration;
```
Here, `periodStart` doesn't change from step 6, `periodEnd` is the `endTime` which is `T + 14 days` as we only have 1 period and we go in the second check. We reach the `duration` calculation and set it as `(T + 14 days) - (T + 7 days) = 7 days`, add it to `totalDuration` and compute the `weightedSum`

8. In this example, we only have 1 iteration (only 1 APY period) so we go out of the loop and have the following code:
```solidity
        if (totalDuration == 0) return 0;
        return weightedSum / totalDuration;
```
We simply divide `weightedSum` by the `totalDuration` where the total duration is equal only to the computed `duration` in the loop as we only did 1 loop, the return value will simply be the period rate of 1e17.

9. We use the rate of 1e17 to compute the interest, back in the main function:
```solidity
uint256 periodInterest = ((user.balance * apy * (periodEnd - periodStart)) / (SECONDS_IN_YEAR * PRECISION)) / 100;
```
The calculation works as follows (we will remove the extra division by 100 as we explained in step 1):
`(X * 1e17 * ((T + 14 days) - T)) / (365 days * 1e18) = (X * 1e17 * 14 days) / (365 days * 1e18) = (X * 1e17 * 14 * 86400) / (365 * 86400 * 1e18)`

If we imagine the user staked 1e18, then result is 3835616438356164. However, as seen in the calculation, this is the interest for 2 full weeks of interest when we should have only received interest for 1 week as the APY period started 1 week after our stake. In our case, the returned `apy` from the function should have been `5e16` instead of `1e17` as we should have 1 week of no interest as user staked 1 week before the APY period.

### Impact

Users staking before an APY period receive more interest than supposed to, loss of funds for protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Move `totalDuration` before the if block shown in the snippet below and then change the if block as shown, that way the division at the end of the function factors in the 1 week of no interest:
```diff
        // Handle case when startTime is before first recorded APY
        if (startTime < apyPeriods[0].startTime) {
            startTime = apyPeriods[0].startTime;
+           totalDuration += apyPeriods[0].startTime - startTime;
            if (startTime >= endTime) return apyPeriods[0].rate;
        }
```
