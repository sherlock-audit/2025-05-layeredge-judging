# [Medium] Rebasing token behavior will corrupt internal accounting in LayerEdgeStaking::_stake()

### Summary

The protocol's assumption of static token balances will cause incorrect accounting for user and total stakes as rebasing tokens silently mutate contract balances without updates to `user.balance` or `totalStaked`.

### Root Cause

In `LayerEdgeStaking.sol::_stake`, the contract assumes that the result of `transferFrom()` accurately represents the number of tokens received. However, rebasing tokens can change balances arbitrarily at any time, including the contract's balance, after the fact. This causes desynchronization between `stakingToken.balanceOf(address(this))` and the internal values `user.balance` and `totalStaked`.

```solidity
674:     function _stake(uint256 amount, address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
675:         require(amount > 0, "Cannot stake zero amount");
676:
677:         UserInfo storage user = users[userAddr];
678:
679:         // Update interest before changing balance
680:         _updateInterest(userAddr);
681:
682:         // Transfer tokens from user to contract
683:         if (!isNative) {
684:@>          require(stakingToken.transferFrom(userAddr, address(this), amount), "Token transfer failed");
685:         } else {
686:             IWETH(address(stakingToken)).deposit{value: amount}();
687:         }
688:
689:         Tier tier = Tier.Tier3;
...
716:@>      user.balance += amount;
717:         user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;
718:
719:         // Update total staked
720:@>      totalStaked += amount;
721:
722:         emit Staked(userAddr, amount, tier);
723:     }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin allows staking of an ERC20-compliant token that performs positive or negative rebasing (e.g., Ampleforth, stETH).
2. User successfully stakes the rebasing token through the `_stake()` function.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The rebasing token performs a rebase that increases or decreases the contract's balance after the stake is complete.


### Attack Path


1. Alice stakes 100 tokens into `LayerEdgeStaking` using a positive rebasing token.
2. Contract assumes `user.balance += 100` and `totalStaked += 100`, regardless of how many tokens were actually received or later adjusted.
3. Later, the token contract performs a rebase, increasing the contract’s balance by 10% (e.g., `balanceOf(address(this))` becomes 110).
4. When rewards are calculated or users unstake, they may withdraw more tokens than they actually contribute - or the system will account incorrectly.


### Impact

The protocol's internal `user.balance` and `totalStaked` values become unsynchronized from actual on-chain balances.

- Users may withdraw more or less than they deserve.
- Reward calculation becomes inconsistent.
- In extreme cases, protocol funds could be drained or interest logic bricked due to accounting mismatch.

This could result in **incorrect reward distributions**, **withdrawal failures**, or even **fund loss**.

### Mitigation


- Either disallow rebasing tokens explicitly with a check like:
  ```solidity
  require(stakingToken.totalSupply() != 0, "Rebasing token not supported");
  ```
- Or rewrite logic to track actual received tokens (`balanceBefore` / `balanceAfter` pattern), and handle totalStaked accordingly.
