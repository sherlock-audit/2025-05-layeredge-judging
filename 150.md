# Unbounded Stake/Unstake Operations Leading to Contract Denial-of-Service

### Summary

The contract allows users to create an unlimited number of stake/unstake requests. Processing these requests consumes gas linearly with the queue length, eventually exceeding Ethereum’s block gas limit (~30M gas) and rendering the contract unusable. A user can stake above the min stake to be added as a tier 1 and then flood the protocol with span 1 wei stakes to make the contract unusable. Or even worse, an attacker determined to take down the protocol can use this. Although it cost to execute this attack its still a critical flaw.

### Root Cause

In the `LayerEdgeStaking.sol`, the contract allows users to create an unlimited number of [`stake`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L674-L723) and [`unstake`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L725-L755) requests. 

There is:
- No minimum stake amount (e.g., dust stakes of 1 wei allowed).
- Tier calculations or user tracking use gas-heavy data structures (e.g., per-stake updates).
- No limit on unstake requests per user.
- Unstake processing iterates over a queue with O(n) gas complexity.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

1. Attacker stakes above the `MIN_STAKE` to stay at the top tier
2. Attacker send many small stakes/unstakes to reach the gas limit

### Attack Path

Stake Spam

1. Attacker submits thousands of stake(1 wei) transactions.
2. Contract updates tier rankings, Fenwick Tree, or user balances for each stake.
3. Legitimate users’ transactions (e.g., stake(), claimRewards()) revert due to gas limits.

### Impact

The protocol becomes unusable. Users can not stake not unstake cause a serious critical DoS. 

Note: The attack will cost the attack much but when executed, it can cause a serious damage to the protocol at large

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Set a limit on the min amount even a tier 3 will have to stake and number  of requests a user can make for unstake
