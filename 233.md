# Inadequate Balance Tracking for Staking and Native Tokens and it allows a loss for the user

### Summary
The `LayerEdgeStaking` contract lacks proper balance tracking for ERC20 staking tokens and native tokens, leading to potential user losses. Users can inadvertently withdraw more staking tokens than they deposited, resulting in an unintended reduction of their native token balance. This issue arises from the protocol's failure to differentiate between the two token types in its balance management logic.

### Vulnerability Details
- **Type**: Logic Flaw
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Components Affected**: `stake`, `stakeNative`, `unstake`, `completeUnstake`
- **Impact**: Users may experience a loss of native tokens when attempting to withdraw more staking tokens than they deposited, due to the protocol's inadequate balance tracking.

### Exploit Scenario
1. **Initial Staking**:
   - The user stakes 300 ERC20 staking tokens by calling the [stake](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L161) function.
   - The user then stakes 100 native tokens by calling the [stakeNative](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L168) function.

2. **Unstaking**:
   - The user attempts to unstake 350 staking tokens by calling the [unstake](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L176) function.
   - The protocol allows this withdrawal, even though the user only deposited 300 staking tokens.

3. **Completion of Unstake**:
   - The user calls the [completeUnstake](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L184) function to finalize the withdrawal.
   - The protocol deducts the extra 50 tokens from the user's native token balance, resulting in a loss for the user.

* It is a more protocol mistake rather than a user mistake. If the user has only 300 Stake tokens, then he shouldn't be allowed to withdraw more than 300 Stake tokens and lose on his Native tokens

### Steps to Exploit
1. **Stake ERC20 Tokens**:
   - Call the `stake` function with 300 ERC20 tokens.

2. **Stake Native Tokens**:
   - Call the `stakeNative` function with 100 native tokens.

3. **Unstake Excessive Amount**:
   - Call the `unstake` function to withdraw 350 staking tokens.

4. **Complete Unstake**:
   - Call the `completeUnstake` function to receive the tokens, resulting in a deduction from the native token balance.

### Recommendations
- **Separate Balance Tracking**: Implement distinct balance tracking for ERC20 staking tokens and native tokens to prevent cross-token deductions.
- **Withdrawal Validation**: Introduce logic to validate withdrawal requests against the specific token type balances, ensuring users cannot withdraw more than they deposited for each token type.
- **User Notification**: Provide clear notifications to users when their actions may result in cross-token deductions, allowing them to make informed decisions.

By addressing these issues, the protocol can prevent unintended losses for users and ensure a more robust and user-friendly staking experience.
