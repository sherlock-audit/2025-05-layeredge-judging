# Incorrect Interest Calculation Due to Premature lastClaimTime Update

### Summary

In the staking contract, interest accrual depends on the interval between lastClaimTime and block.timestamp. However, this variable is prematurely updated during stake and unstake operations—even though no interest is claimed—causing unclaimed interest to be permanently lost if users do not call the claim function between actions.

This results in incorrect reward calculations and user dissatisfaction due to unexpected loss of accrued rewards.

### Root Cause

The contract updates user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp in both _stake() and _unstake() after calling _updateInterest(userAddr), which internally relies on lastClaimTime to calculate accrued rewards.

This pattern introduces a temporal inconsistency:

_updateInterest() is called → calculates interest since lastClaimTime

lastClaimTime is then reset, regardless of whether interest was claimed

As a result, any future interest calculations mistakenly treat the new lastClaimTime as the starting point, eliminating the accrual window prior to this stake/unstake action.

### Attack Path

Step 1: Stake Tokens and Wait
You stake 100 tokens.

Wait 30 days with no claim.

Your interestEarned = 0 but the contract could compute ~X tokens in unclaimed interest based on lastClaimTime.

Step 2: Stake Again or Unstake Small Amount
Call _stake(50) or _unstake(10):

_updateInterest() is called: it calculates your unclaimed interest for 30 days and updates user.interestEarned.

Then immediately, user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp.

 Step 3: Silent Loss
If your calculated interest was rounded to zero, then:

Nothing gets added to interestEarned.

But lastClaimTime is still updated.

The effect? The system erases your entire 30-day staking history without rewarding you.

On the next claim, the 30 days are lost forever.

### Impact

_updateInterest() is called when interestEarned == 0, and lastClaimTime is set immediately after, no interest is recorded, and future calculations lose that unclaimed period.

### Mitigation

Don’t update lastClaimTime unless interestEarned was actually increased.

Only update lastClaimTime on successful claim, not on stake/unstake.

Implement a separate lastUpdateTime field to track stake activity, while reserving lastClaimTime solely for reward accounting.
