# Hard fallback revert prevents future integrations or proxy-based extensions

### Summary

The use of a fallback() that reverts unconditionally will cause upgrade failures and integration limits for the protocol as it blocks any dynamic or proxy-encoded calls.

### Root Cause

In [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#193](https://github.com/zaid261-spec/2025-05-layeredge-zaid261-spec/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L193), the fallback() function includes only revert("Fallback not allowed");. While intended for security, this causes all unknown interface calls — including proxy or admin UUPS upgrade calls — to break silently or be permanently blocked.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A call is made to the contract using an unknown selector
2. Caller expects fallback to handle routing

### External Pre-conditions

1. A tool, protocol, or proxy (e.g. Safe, DeFi routers) uses low-level call forwarding

### Attack Path

1. Proxy contract forwards delegatecall to staking contract
2. Function selector isn't explicitly defined in the ABI
3. Fallback reverts — preventing upgrade, integration, or flexible meta-transaction support

### Impact

The contract becomes difficult or impossible to integrate with proxy-based admin systems (e.g., UUPS), Safe modules, or low-level DeFi tools. It hurts extensibility and safe maintenance.

### PoC

// Call unknown selector via Foundry script
// Expect fallback revert


### Mitigation

Remove hard revert in fallback() or add conditional handling for admin paths. At minimum, document that UUPS-compatible entry points must not rely on fallback.
