# In `LayerEdgeStaking.sol` an adversary can monopolize tier 1/2 APY and permanently DoS access to tier 1 and 2 locking new stakers out of the tiers.

### Summary

The combination of non-recyclable `joinId`s and max cap of 100 Million users for tiers 1/2 in the staking contract can cause a permanent DoS for all future stakers as a malicious staker can use disposable wallets to burn through the entire fixed supply of "in-tree" staking slots, leaving their own "whale" wallet as the sole participant  and or with only a few other stakers that managed to stake quickly in the high-yield tiering system for the lifetime of the contract.

Worth noting that a key invariant is also broken

> Tier distribution correctness: Exactly 20% in Tier 1, 30% in Tier 2, and 50% in Tier 3 (with minimum guarantees of at least 1 user per tier when applicable)

### Root Cause

The choice to design the tiering system around a finite, non-recyclable `joinId` is a mistake, as it creates a depletable resource that can be permanently consumed.

- In [`LayerEdgeStaking.sol:_stake`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L674-L723), the nextJoinId is always incremented for a new staker entering the tiering system, with no mechanism to reuse old slots.
- In `LayerEdgeStaking.sol:_unstake`, when a staker's balance drops below minStakeAmount, their joinId is effectively abandoned. It is not added to a list of free slots to be recycled for future stakers.

This design allows an adversary to permanently reduce the number of available staking slots, a vulnerability that becomes critical when the potential profit outweighs the cost in the long run.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

1. Adversary needs to have sufficient capital

### Attack Path

1. The adversary stakes the initial amount needed to enter tier 1 on his main wallet
2. He then batches enough using multiple wallets in order for each wallet to be placed in the "in-tree" slot
3. He then calls `unstake()` for all these wallets and after the 7 day wait period calls `completeUnstake()` and gets back their capital.
4. Repeats step 2 and 3 multiple times using new wallets and burns through the `joinId` slots

### Impact

This is a profitable, high-severity attack that breaks the core functionality of the protocol.

The entire user base (excluding the attacker and maybe a few other stakers who got in early) unfairly suffers a permanent DoS to tiers 1 and 2. They can no longer participate in the contract's primary feature—tiered staking—and are denied any opportunity to earn yield higher yield than tier 3 yield.

The attacker gains a permanent and exclusive monopoly over the high-yield tiers. By ensuring no one else can ever join, their whale wallet is guaranteed to receive the maximum Tier 1 APY on its large principal for the lifetime of the contract. The profit from this guaranteed yield will significantly outweigh the gas cost of the attack.

Even if the adversary cannot stop new stakers from joining tiers 1/2 while still in the process of the attack, which can take weeks/months to fully complete based on the capital, but the attacker can ensure a large chunk of the slots are permanently used up, while only spending on gas costs and getting back his funds with each unstake on the multipe wallets, he can then increase his stake on the main wallet once the attack is complete, the earnings over time will far outweigh the cost.

### Mitigation

Consider recycling `joinIds`:

Modify the contract to treat joinIds as a reusable resource.

- Introduce a freeSlots array: uint256[] private freeSlots;
- In _unstake, when a user's joinId is freed, add it to the array: freeSlots.push(user.joinId);
- In _stake, prioritize using a recycled ID before consuming a new one:

```solidity
uint256 joinId;
if (freeSlots.length > 0) {
  joinId = freeSlots.pop();
} else {
  require(nextJoinId <= MAX_USERS, "All slots used");
  joinId = nextJoinId++;
}
user.joinId = joinId;
```
