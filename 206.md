# `nextJoinId` Reset on Upgrade Corrupts Staker Ranking

### Summary

The LayerEdge system is governed by a first come, first serve system using a Feenwick Tree to keep track of the order in which addresses stake into the system. `nextJoinId` is crucial to the accuracy of this system.

NextJoinId is set to 1 when the proxy is deployed and initialize is called:
```solidity
Function initialize(address _stakingToken, address _admin) public initializer {
...SNIP...
        nextJoinId = 1;
...SNIP...
}
```
This is very dangerous because if the contract is upgraded and this isn't removed, the entire ranking system breaks.

### Root Cause

Key state variable is set to 1 in `initialize()` in an upgradeable contract:

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. LayerEdge upgrades the staking contract and doesn't remove the line setting `nextJoinId` to 1. 

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. LayerEdge upgrades their staking contract, adding a new Tier.
2. LayerEdge doesn't change the initialize function
3. NextJoinId is reset to 1, breaking the integrity of the staking system.

### Impact

There are many implications of this. The most obvious is it lets new stakers effectively "cut the line." It also breaks stake tracking in `stakerAddress`, `stakerTree.query` queries the wrong rank and therefore potentially the wrong tier, and more.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Increment `nextJoinId` before setting `user.joinId` in _stake() and remove this line from initialize().
