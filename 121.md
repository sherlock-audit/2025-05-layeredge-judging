# Malicious input can corrupt protocol state via FenwickTree underflow

### Summary

The missing underflow check in FenwickTree.sol:update() will cause state corruption for the protocol as a user or protocol admin will call update() with a negative delta greater than the current stored value, resulting in an underflow and causing the tree to store an abnormally large number at the affected index, breaking all subsequent tier and ranking calculations.

### Root Cause

In [FenwickTree.sol:10](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/library/FenwickTree.sol#L10) (update()), there is a missing check to ensure self.data[index] is at least uint256(-delta) before applying a negative delta, which allows underflow and corrupts the mapping.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A Fenwick tree index contains a small value (e.g., 1).
2. User or protocol logic calls update() on that index with a negative delta larger than the stored value (e.g., -2).

### External Pre-conditions

No external protocol, price feed, or network conditions are required. All steps occur within LayerEdge and the attackerâ€™s contract.

### Attack Path

1. Protocol or attacker calls tree.update(index, -2) where tree.data[index] is 1.
2. This causes an underflow, setting tree.data[index] to 2^256 - 1.
3. All subsequent prefix sum, ranking, or tier assignment logic is corrupted, breaking the staking system.

### Impact

The protocol suffers permanent state corruption. User ranks and tiers may be permanently incorrect, rewards may be unfairly assigned, and protocol accounting is broken. This bug does not only affect the attacker, but can permanently break core accounting and tier logic for all users, requiring a contract migration to recover. All users and funds relying on tier or ranking calculations are at risk.

### PoC

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "./FenwickTree.sol"; // Make sure this library is accessible

contract FenwickUnderflowPoC {
    using FenwickTree for FenwickTree.Tree;

    FenwickTree.Tree private tree;

    constructor() {
        tree.size = 10;
        tree.data[3] = 1; // Set index 3 to value 1
    }

    function triggerUnderflow() external {
        tree.update(3, -2); // Underflow: 1 + (-2) = -1 => uint256(-1)
    }

    function getValue(uint256 index) external view returns (uint256) {
        return tree.data[index];
    }
}


How to use:

1. Deploy the FenwickUnderflowPoC contract.

2. Call triggerUnderflow().

3. Then call getValue(3).

4. The returned value will be 2^256 - 1 (the maximum uint256), showing tree corruption.

### Mitigation

Add a check that ensures self.data[index] >= uint256(-delta) before subtracting a negative delta.
