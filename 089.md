# Integer Division in Tier Calculation leads to Inaccurate Staker Allocation, Systematically Over-representing Tier 3

### Summary

The `LayerEdgeStaking` contract aims to distribute stakers into three tiers with target percentages: 20% for Tier 1, 30% for Tier 2, and 50% for Tier 3. The `getTierCountForStakerCount` [function ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L480)is responsible for calculating the number of users allocated to each tier.

However, this function calculates the counts for Tier 1 and Tier 2 using integer division:
-   `tier1Count = (stakerCount * TIER1_PERCENTAGE) / 100;`
-   `calculatedTier2Count = (stakerCount * TIER2_PERCENTAGE) / 100;`

Integer division truncates any decimal part of the result. For example, if `(stakerCount * TIER1_PERCENTAGE)` is 199, `199 / 100` results in `1`, not `1.99`. This means Tier 1 and Tier 2 often receive fewer stakers than if a rounding method (e.g., round to nearest, or largest remainder) were used. Tier 3's count is subsequently calculated as the total stakers minus those allocated to Tier 1 and Tier 2 (`stakerCount - tier1Count - tier2Count`). As a result, Tier 3 absorbs the truncated fractions from the Tier 1 and Tier 2 calculations, leading to it being consistently overrepresented relative to its 50% target.

While the contract includes a minimum guarantee clause (ensuring at least one user per tier if stakers exist for that tier), this primarily affects scenarios with very low total staker counts (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4 stakers). For larger staker counts, the flooring effect of integer division becomes the dominant factor causing the deviation from the "exact" target percentages.

### Root Cause

The root cause is the use of integer division in the `getTierCountForStakerCount` function (lines 434 and 444 of `LayerEdgeStaking.sol`):

```solidity
// LayerEdgeStaking.sol:434
tier1Count = (stakerCount * TIER1_PERCENTAGE) / 100;

// LayerEdgeStaking.sol:444
uint256 calculatedTier2Count = (stakerCount * TIER2_PERCENTAGE) / 100;
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The contract has active stakers (`stakerCountInTree` > 0).
- The issue is most pronounced when (`stakerCountInTree` * `TIER1_PERCENTAGE`) or (`stakerCountInTree` * `TIER2_PERCENTAGE`) are not perfectly divisible by 100.
- `TIER1_PERCENTAGE` is 20.
- `TIER2_PERCENTAGE` is 30.


### External Pre-conditions

Users stake tokens into the contract, increasing `stakerCountInTree`.

### Attack Path

1. When staker tier distributions are calculated by getTierCountForStakerCount (e.g., during staking, unstaking, or via view functions like getCurrentTier which calls _computeTierByRank):
2. tier1Count is computed. For stakerCount = 9, tier1Count = (9 * 20) / 100 = 180 / 100 = 1. (Target: 20% of 9 = 1.8).
3. The "at least 1 staker in tier 1" rule (if (tier1Count == 0 && stakerCount > 0) { tier1Count = 1; }) is applied if necessary but doesn't alter the truncation for non-zero results.
4. calculatedTier2Count is computed. For stakerCount = 9, calculatedTier2Count = (9 * 30) / 100 = 270 / 100 = 2. (Target: 30% of 9 = 2.7).
5. The "at least 1 staker in tier 2" rule (if (calculatedTier2Count == 0 && remainingAfterTier1 > 0) { tier2Count = 1; }) is applied if necessary. tier2Count is also capped by remainingAfterTier1. For stakerCount = 9, tier1Count = 1, remainingAfterTier1 = 8, so tier2Count remains 2.
6. tier3Count is calculated as stakerCount - tier1Count - tier2Count. For stakerCount = 9, tier3Count = 9 - 1 - 2 = 6. (Target: 50% of 9 = 4.5).
For stakerCount = 9:

- Actual Distribution: Tier 1: 1 (11.1%), Tier 2: 2 (22.2%), Tier 3: 6 (66.7%).
- Target Percentages: Tier 1: 20% (1.8), Tier 2: 30% (2.7), Tier 3: 50% (4.5).

Tier 1 loses 0.8 stakers, Tier 2 loses 0.7 stakers, and Tier 3 gains these 1.5 stakers compared to a proportional distribution based on precise percentages. This pattern persists across various staker counts where results are not whole numbers.


### Impact

- Skewed Tier Distribution: The actual distribution of stakers across tiers will consistently deviate from the intended 20%/30%/50% target. Tier 1 and Tier 2 will be underrepresented, while Tier 3 will be overrepresented.
- Example with stakerCount = 14:
- Target: T1=2.8 (20%), T2=4.2 (30%), T3=7.0 (50%)
- Actual: T1=2 (14.3%), T2=4 (28.6%), T3=8 (57.1%)
- Deviation from Protocol Specification: The contract does not achieve the specified target percentages for tier allocation as accurately as it could.
- Potential Economic Implications: Stakers might be placed in a tier different from what a more precise rounding method would assign. If APY rates vary significantly between tiers (e.g., Tier 1 & 2 have higher APYs), fewer users will benefit from the more advantageous rates, and more users will be assigned to Tier 3, which might have a lower APY. This could affect the overall attractiveness and perceived fairness of the staking mechanism.
- User Expectation Mismatch: Users expecting tier allocations to closely match the advertised percentages may find the actual distribution unfair or not as intended, potentially impacting trust.
