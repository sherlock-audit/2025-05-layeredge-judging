### Title: 
LayerEdgeStaking::calculateUnclaimedInterest may ignore recent tier change in same block. 

Description

In the function LayerEdgeStaking::calculateUnclaimedInterest, if a user changes tier (like moving to Tier 1) and then calls claimInterest() or compoundInterest() in the same block, the function will skip that recent tier record. This happens because of this line:

if (record.timestamp >= block.timestamp) break;

If the tier record has a timestamp that is equal to the current block, it gets ignored and not used for interest calculation.

This means the user gets paid only for the old tier time, and the new tier is missed completely.

Impact

Users may lose interest they should have earned. The tier record is correct and in history, but the function doesn't use it because of the timestamp check.

This breaks the rule stated in the Q&A:

> “User rewards must be calculated correctly based on their tier history, time staked, and APY rates.”

Proof of Concepts

1. User stakes and gets into Tier 2


2. After some time, they increase stake and move into Tier 1


3. In the same block, they call claimInterest()


4. The latest Tier 1 change has a timestamp equal to block.timestamp


5. The line if (record.timestamp >= block.timestamp) break; skips it


6. So the Tier 1 time is not counted, and the user loses interest

Recommended mitigation

Change the logic to include tier records that start in the current block.
Instead of >=, use > or redesign the loop so tier records within the current block are still counted if valid.

For example:

if (record.timestamp > block.timestamp) break;

Also consider handling exact-timestamp tier updates more clearly so that no user time is missed.
