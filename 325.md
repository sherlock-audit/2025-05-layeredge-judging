# Interest Calculation Stops During Unstaking Window

### Summary

The contract stops calculating interest for users during the unstaking window period (7 days) between when an unstake request is created and when it is actually completed. This means users lose potential interest earnings during this waiting period.

### Root Cause

In the `_unstake` function, after creating an unstake request, the contract does not continue to calculate interest for the requested amount during the 7-day unstaking window. The interest calculation only resumes after the unstake request is completed.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User has staked tokens in the contract
2. User initiates an unstake request

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. User stakes tokens in the contract
2. User initiates an unstake request
3. During the 7-day unstaking window, the requested amount stops earning interest
4. User completes the unstake request after the window
5. User loses potential interest earnings during the waiting period

### Impact

- Users lose potential interest earnings during the unstaking window
- The longer the unstaking window, the more interest is lost
- Medium severity as it affects user rewards but doesn't lead to direct fund loss


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Continue calculating interest for the requested amount during the unstaking window
