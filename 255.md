# Users will bypass minimum stake requirements through multiple small deposits

### Summary

The selective enforcement of minStakeAmount only on first deposits will cause protocol integrity degradation for all stakers as users can circumvent tier qualification rules through deposit splitting

### Root Cause

In `LayerEdgeStaking.sol:_stake()` the minimum stake check only applies when `!user.isActive`, allowing subsequent deposits of any size. This is a design choice mistake as it undermines the tier system's economic security assumptions.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Protocol must have `minStakeAmount > 0` set
2. User must not have any existing active stake (`isActive == false`)
3. User must have sufficient token balance to make multiple small deposits

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. **User makes initial deposit of 1 wei (below minStakeAmount)**
   - Gets permanently marked as Tier 3 (`outOfTree = true`)
2. **User makes 3000 subsequent deposits of 1 wei each**
   - Each bypasses minimum check due to `isActive == true`
   - Accumulates significant stake while remaining in Tier 3
3. **User eventually qualifies for higher tiers by total stake**
   - But remains stuck in Tier 3 due to initial flag

### Impact

The protocol suffers distorted tier distributions as:
1. Legitimate users face unfair competition from "gaming" accounts
2. Tier APY calculations become inaccurate
3. Reward distribution becomes skewed towards manipulators

### PoC

1. Protocol sets `minStakeAmount = 3000 tokens`
2. Alice stakes 1 token (first deposit)
   - Contract sets `isActive = true` and `outOfTree = true`
3. Alice makes 3000 transactions staking 1 token each
   - No minimum check occurs after first deposit
   - Final balance: 3001 tokens
4. Alice remains in Tier 3 despite having >minStakeAmount
   - Earns lower APY than deserved
   - Still occupies protocol capacity

### Mitigation

Enforce minimum stake consistently:

```solidity
function _stake(uint256 amount, address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
    require(
        amount >= minStakeAmount || 
        (user.isActive && user.balance + amount >= minStakeAmount),
        "Deposit below minimum"
    );
    
    // Rest of existing logic...
    
    // Additional check for reactivation
    if (user.outOfTree && user.balance + amount >= minStakeAmount) {
        stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1);
        stakerCountInTree++;
        stakerCountOutOfTree--;
        user.outOfTree = false;
    }
}
```
