# Users receive rewards despite there being no APY period

### Summary

Users receive rewards despite there being no APY period

### Root Cause

In `getTierForAPYPeriod()`, we have the following code:
```solidity
        if (startTime < apyPeriods[0].startTime) {
            startTime = apyPeriods[0].startTime;
            if (startTime >= endTime) return apyPeriods[0].rate;
        }
```
If the start time of a user's tier period (e.g. staked) before the APY period start time, we set the `startTime` based on the period start time. Then, if the `startTime` moved after the user's tier period end time, we return the APY period's rate. However, that is incorrect as no APY period was available during that period and the user must not receive any APY for that period.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- user must stake before the first APY period, e.g. the APY period must be set with some delay, the code explicitly handles it

### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

1. User stakes before the first period and he has a second tier period with a start after some time, no APY period has been set yet
2. APY period is set and user claims his interest, we reach here:
```solidity
        if (startTime < apyPeriods[0].startTime) {
            startTime = apyPeriods[0].startTime;
            if (startTime >= endTime) return apyPeriods[0].rate;
        }
```
3. We go in the check as the user stakes before the period start, we set the start time accordingly and we return in the check as the second tier period was also before the APY period, as explained in step 1
4. We return the rate of that period, however that is incorrect as the user's tier period was fully before the APY period was set

### Impact

Users receive APY, unfairly.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
        if (startTime < apyPeriods[0].startTime) {
            startTime = apyPeriods[0].startTime;
+           if (startTime >= endTime) return 0;
-           if (startTime >= endTime) return apyPeriods[0].rate;

        }
```
