# Tier is changed wrongly in some cases

### Summary

When a new user stakes or existing user unstakes but amount of stakers in tier2 stays the same wrong tier changing occurs sometimes

### Root Cause

```solidity
    function _checkBoundariesAndRecord(bool isRemoval) internal {
        ...
            // Handle case where Tier 2 count stays the same
            else if (isRemoval) {
@>              _findAndRecordTierChange(new_t1 + new_t2, n);
            } else if (!isRemoval) {
@>              _findAndRecordTierChange(old_t1 + old_t2, n);
            }
        }
    }
```

The first argument in these lines should be swapped between each other.

### Attack Path

For example there's currently 14 stakers; 2 in tier1, 4 in tier2, 8 in tier3. A new user stakes. Now there is 3 in tier1, 4 in tier2, 8 in tier3. The users than need to be changed tiers have rank 3 (t2 to t1) and rank 7 (t3 to t2). But the code will change user with rank 3  and rank 6 as old_t1 + old_t2 = 2 + 4 = 6. This is wrong as rank 6 will have the same tier but the rank 7 will not. The user affected has APY of tier 3 and not of tier 2 as supposed. If there are 15 stakers and one of them unstakes then rank 7 wont have tiers changed from tier2 to tier3 and will receive more rewards than supposed.

### Impact

Wrong tier calculation with some users having wrong APY and reward calculation

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Swap the arguments on lines mentioned in Root Cause
