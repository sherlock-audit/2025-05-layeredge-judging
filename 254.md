# Stakers will lose access to higher tiers permanently when their balance drops below minStakeAmount

### Summary

The lack of re-entry logic for stakers who increase their balance back above minStakeAmount will cause a permanent demotion to Tier 3 for affected stakers as the protocol fails to restore their eligibility for higher tiers

### Root Cause

In `LayerEdgeStaking.sol` the removal logic in `_unstake()` (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L725-L755) sets `outOfTree = true` when balance drops below `minStakeAmount`, but there's no corresponding mechanism in `_stake()` (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L674-L723) to set `outOfTree = false` when balance increases above `minStakeAmount` again.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to stake an amount â‰¥ `minStakeAmount` to enter the tree initially
2. User needs to unstake sufficient amount to reduce balance below `minStakeAmount`
3. User's `outOfTree` flag gets set to true during the unstake operation
4. User later stakes additional funds to bring balance back above `minStakeAmount`

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. **User stakes 5000 tokens (above minStakeAmount of 3000)**
   - Gets assigned Tier 1 or 2 based on ranking
2. **User unstakes 4000 tokens (leaving 1000, below minStakeAmount)**
   - Gets marked `outOfTree = true` and moved to Tier 3
3. **User stakes 3000 more tokens (total 4000, above minStakeAmount)**
   - Remains stuck in Tier 3 despite now qualifying for higher tiers

### Impact

The affected stakers suffer a permanent reduction in APY (from up to 50% to 20%) even when their staked balance qualifies them for higher tiers. This represents a significant opportunity cost for long-term stakers.

### PoC

1. Alice stakes 5000 tokens when minStakeAmount is 3000
   - She's ranked in top 20% and gets Tier 1 (50% APY)
2. Alice unstakes 4000 tokens due to temporary need
   - Her balance drops to 1000 (<3000)
   - Contract sets `outOfTree = true` and moves her to Tier 3
3. Later, Alice stakes 3000 more tokens (total 4000)
   - Despite now having >3000 tokens, she remains in Tier 3
   - She continues earning only 20% APY instead of potentially 35-50%

### Mitigation

Add re-entry logic in `_stake()`:

```solidity
function _stake(uint256 amount, address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
    // ... existing code ...
    
    if (user.outOfTree && user.balance + amount >= minStakeAmount) {
        stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1);
        stakerCountInTree++;
        stakerCountOutOfTree--;
        user.outOfTree = false;
        
        // Recalculate tier after re-entry
        uint256 rank = stakerTree.query(user.joinId);
        Tier tier = _computeTierByRank(rank, stakerCountInTree);
        _recordTierChange(userAddr, tier);
        _checkBoundariesAndRecord(false);
    }
    
    // ... rest of existing code ...
}
```
Additionally, consider adding a separate function to manually trigger re-entry for affected users.
