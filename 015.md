# Unbounded Admin Parameters

### Summary

Admins can set unlimited APY rates, minStakeAmount, and withdraw unlimited reserves—no on-chain caps exist.

### Root Cause

No max or min constraints coded into setter functions.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Admin wallet has DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE.

### External Pre-conditions

Admin user calls the rate/amount setter functions.

### Attack Path

Malicious or compromised admin could set APY to 0% (freezing rewards) or to huge values (unexpected liquidity drain), or raise minStakeAmount to infinity (blocking new stakes).

### Impact

High: total protocol disruption, denial of service, or fund exfiltration via excessive rewards.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

• Introduce sensible require() bounds (e.g. 0 < APY <= 100%).
• Implement a time-lock on parameter changes.
• Multi-sig for sensitive admin operations.
