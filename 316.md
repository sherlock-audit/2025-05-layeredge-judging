# Division before multiplication and precision loss can lead to lost interest

### Summary

Division before multiplication and precision loss can lead to lost interest

### Root Cause

Interest is calculated as follows:
```solidity
            uint256 apy = getTierAPYForPeriod(periodTier, periodStart, periodEnd);

            uint256 periodInterest = ((user.balance * apy * (periodEnd - periodStart)) / (SECONDS_IN_YEAR * PRECISION)) / 100;
```
Where the `apy` is calculated as follows:
```solidity
return weightedSum / totalDuration;
```
Thus, the whole calculation is:
```solidity
((user.balance * (weightedSum / totalDuration) * (periodEnd - periodStart)) / (SECONDS_IN_YEAR * PRECISION)) / 100;
```
As seen, we first divide the weighted by the total duration before the other multiplications. This, combined with the fact that the denominator is `365 * 86400 * 1e18 * 100 = 3153600000000000000000000000` or `3.1536e27` which is a very big denominator, huge precision can be lost here.

In the worst case possible, if we imagine that the numerator is such that `(numerator + 1) % 3.1536e27 == 0` is true (or instead of the `1` addition, the addition is by a relatively small number), then the precision can be noticeable.
