# Admin-Controlled minStakeAmount Changes Break Invariants

### Summary

The lack of re-evaluation after updating minStakeAmount will cause eligible users to remain excluded from tiers for users as the admin can lower minStakeAmount and still exclude previously disqualified users from tier participation.

### Root Cause

The choice to update minStakeAmount without re-evaluating outOfTree users is a mistake, as it results in protocol state becoming inconsistent with new configuration.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Admin calls setMinStakeAmount(x) to set minStakeAmount to a lower value.

Some users already have a balance ≥ new minStakeAmount but are still marked outOfTree.

### External Pre-conditions

.

### Attack Path

User A has 50 tokens but minStakeAmount is 100 → outOfTree.

Admin lowers minStakeAmount to 40.

User A remains excluded because there is no logic to reinsert them.

### Impact

The user cannot re-enter the tier system despite qualifying, and the protocol enforces inconsistent state violating fairness.

### PoC

```solidity
setMinStakeAmount(100);
user stakes 50 → marked outOfTree

setMinStakeAmount(40);
require(user.balance >= minStakeAmount); // true
require(user.outOfTree == true); // still excluded

```

### Mitigation

Modify setMinStakeAmount() to trigger a loop/recheck or allow self-triggered re-entry
