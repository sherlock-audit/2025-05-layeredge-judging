# ERC20 approve() race condition allows spender to front-run allowance changes

### Summary

The approve() function in the WETH9 contract allows a token holder to set the allowance for a spender. However, it is susceptible to a known ERC20 race condition vulnerability where a malicious spender can front-run a change in allowance, leading to unintended and excessive token transfers.



### Root Cause

The missing check in WETH9.sol approve() function will cause an unintended allowance overspend for token holders as a malicious spender will front-run allowance changes to transfer more tokens than intended.

In WETH9.sol approve() function, the allowance is overwritten without requiring it to be zero first or providing increase/decrease allowance functions, enabling a race condition.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Token holder calls approve(spender, newAllowance) without first setting the allowance to zero.

Spender observes the pending transaction and acts within the same block or before the transaction is mined.

### External Pre-conditions

None specific to external protocols.

### Attack Path

Alice approves Bob to spend 100 tokens: approve(Bob, 100).

Bob spends 60 tokens.

Alice now wants to reduce Bob’s allowance to 20: approve(Bob, 20).

Before the new approval confirms, Bob front-runs the transaction and spends the remaining 40.

Now Bob has spent the full 100, and the new 20 allowance will be applied after the fact — which Alice didn’t intend.

This leaves Alice with less control over her tokens and opens up an attack vector for front-running bots or malicious dApps.

### Impact

This implementation overwrites the existing allowance without checking if the previous one was used. If a token holder tries to reduce a spender’s allowance, and the spender detects this on-chain, they can quickly:

Front-run the approve() transaction.

Call transferFrom() using the old allowance.

Drain tokens before the new (reduced) allowance takes effect.

This can result in the spender transferring more tokens than the token holder intended to permit, especially in fast-moving DeFi environments.

### PoC

Will Provide a Coded POC on request

### Mitigation

There are two standard mitigation strategies:

Option 1: Add increaseAllowance() and decreaseAllowance()

function increaseAllowance(address guy, uint256 addedValue) public returns (bool) {
    allowance[msg.sender][guy] += addedValue;
    emit Approval(msg.sender, guy, allowance[msg.sender][guy]);
    return true;
}

function decreaseAllowance(address guy, uint256 subtractedValue) public returns (bool) {
    uint256 current = allowance[msg.sender][guy];
    require(current >= subtractedValue, "decreased allowance below zero");
    allowance[msg.sender][guy] = current - subtractedValue;
    emit Approval(msg.sender, guy, allowance[msg.sender][guy]);
    return true;
}
These functions mitigate the vulnerability by ensuring the spender can only adjust their allowance incrementally.
