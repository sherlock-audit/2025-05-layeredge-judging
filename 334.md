###Title: LayerEdgeStaking::unstake allows user to bypass tier demotion logic with quick unstake-restake.

Description

When a user unstakes below minStakeAmount, the system is supposed to move them permanently to Tier 3 (lowest tier). But if they unstake and immediately restake in the same block or before updateTierOnChange catches it, they can avoid getting moved down. This breaks the permanent Tier 3 demotion rule described in the Q&A.

Impact

Users can avoid tier punishment.
May keep farming higher APY unfairly.
Breaks the rule:
> “Users who unstake below minStakeAmount should permanently remain in Tier 3.”

Proof of Concept

1. User unstakes part of their funds — drops below min amount


2. Before tier is updated, they stake again to go back above the limit


3. Since both actions happen close together, updateTierOnChange() doesn't lock them into Tier 3


4. They keep Tier 2 or Tier 1 without penalty
