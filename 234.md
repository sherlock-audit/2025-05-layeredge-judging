# Tiers of users surrounding Tier2-Tier3 boundary were not updated correctly if a staker in Tier 3 of  tiering system unstakes  when total users in tiering system is in form of 10N+5

### Summary

When a user who was in tiering system unstakes such that his total balance will become below minStakeAmount people's tier will be changed and the method _checkBoundariesAndRecord should find exactly whose tier is going to change and record them. Such that Tier1,Tier2,Tier3 should have (20,30,50) percent of total users in tier system respectively. below more precisely,
If total number of users in tier system are X then,

users in tier 1 should be =(integral part of 20 percent of X) = ⌊X/5⌋.(Floor of x/5)
users in tier 2 should be =(integral part of 30 percent of X) =⌊3X/10⌋.(Floor of 3x/10)
users in tier 3 should be =X-(total users in tier 1+total users in tier 2).
Above are core invarients of the system as mentioned on contest page(Breaking these is a concern).
But _checkBoundariesAndRecord function not updating tier of a particular user at (Tier2-Tier3) boundary, when total users before unstaking is in form of 10N+5 where N is a natural number and unstaked user was initially belongs to Tier 3 of tiering system.
Let's define some variables,
1)Total number of users in tier 1 before unstake = old_t1.
2)Total number of users in tier 1 after unstake = new_t1.
3)Total number of users in tier 2 before unstake = old_t2.
4) Total number of users in tier 2 after unstake = new_t2.
5) Total number of users in tier 3 before unstake = old_t3.
6)Total number of users in tier 3 after unstake = new_t3.
so lets calculate these values when total number of stakers in tier system before this unstake = 10N+5 and total number of stakers in tier system after this unstake = 10N+4.
1) old_t1= ⌊2N+1⌋ = 2N+1
2)new_t1=⌊2N+0.8⌋=2N
3)old_t2=⌊3N+1.5⌋ =3N+1
4)new_t2= ⌊3N+1.2⌋ = 3N+1
5)old_t3=10N+5-(2N+1+3N+1)=5N+3
6)new_t3=10N+4-(2N+3N+1)=5N+3
where, ⌊X⌋= floor of X (greatest integer less than or equal to X).
let's see diagram which divides users into [Tier1], [Tier2], [Tier3](before the unstake).
<pre><code> [1 → 2 → 3 → ...→ 2N-1 → 2N → 2N+1] [2N+2 → 2N+3 → .....→ 5N → 5N+1 → 5N+2] [5N+3 → 5N+4 → ... → 10N+5] </code></pre>
now let's see how removing a user who is in Tier3 from tier system will modify tiers of the existing users.

As we can see new_t1 = old_t1 - 1, for this to happen 2N+1 should be changed to Tier2.( this is the change at Tier1-Tier2 boundary).
Next as new_t2 = old_t2, for this to happen 5N+2 should be changed to Tier 3.( because at Tier1-Tier2 boundary one user going to Tier 2 but total number of users in Tier 2 should be same as before so we should add 5N+2 to Tier 3.
Next we can see new_t3 = old_t3, no additional change is required because 5N+2 will be added to Tier 3 and  a user in Tier 3 is going out so the condition that new_t3 = old_t3 will be satisfied.
now let's see the diagram which divides users into [Tier1], [Tier2], [Tier3] ( After the unstake).
<pre><code> [1 → 2 → 3 → ...→ 2N-1 → 2N] [2N+1 → 2N+2 → .....→ 5N → 5N+1] [5N+2 → 5N+3 → ... → 10N+4] </code></pre>

so here 2 things should be happen
1)2N+1 should be changed to Tier2 from Tier 1.
2)5N+2 should be changed to Tier 3 from Tier 2.

Let's see how _checkBoundariesAndRecord function is modifying tiers of users surrounding boundary of Tier2-Tier3 in this particular case,
for that first let's calculate some values used in function,
1)(new_t2 = old_t2) = 3N+1
old_t1 > new_t1 (2N+1 > 2N)
3)(new_t3=old_t3) = 5N+3
4)isRemoval = true as here staker is removed from tiering system.
6)old_t1 + old_t2 = 2N+1 + 3N+1 = 5N+2.
new_t1 + new_t2 = 2N + 3N + 1 = 5N+1.

```solidity
        // Tier 2 boundary handling
        if (new_t1 + new_t2 > 0) {
            if (new_t2 != old_t2) {
                // Need to update all users between the old and new tier 2 boundaries
                uint256 old_boundary = old_t1 + old_t2;
                uint256 new_boundary = new_t1 + new_t2;


                if (new_boundary > old_boundary) {
                    // Promotion case: update all users from old_boundary+1 to new_boundary
                    for (uint256 rank = old_boundary + 1; rank <= new_boundary; rank++) {
                        _findAndRecordTierChange(rank, n);
                    }
                } else {
                    // Demotion case: update all users from new_boundary+1 to old_boundary
                    for (uint256 rank = new_boundary + 1; rank <= old_boundary; rank++) {
                        _findAndRecordTierChange(rank, n);
                    }
                }
            }
            // Handle case where Tier 2 count stays the same
            else if (isRemoval) {
                _findAndRecordTierChange(new_t1 + new_t2, n);
            } else if (!isRemoval) {
                _findAndRecordTierChange(old_t1 + old_t2, n);
            }
        }
    }
```
As new_t2 = old_t2 and isRemoval = true , the above code will execute this if statement.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L894-L895
```solidity
            else if (isRemoval) {
                _findAndRecordTierChange(new_t1 + new_t2, n);
```
so here comes the bug ,
new_t1 + new_t2 = 5N+1 so here at Tier 2-Tier 3 boundary in the current implementation of code, it was trying to modify Tier of user ranked 5N+1(but it will be same as before (Tier2)). but it should actually try to modify Tier of 5N + 2.
so as it was not changing Tier of user ranked 5N+2, Tier of 5N+2 remains as Tier 2.
so tier of 5N+2 was not changed to Tier 3 .
so this breaks core invariant.(no of users in Tier 2 should be 3N+1 but now it was 3N+2 and no of users in Tier 3 should be 5N+3 but now it will be 5N+2).
consequence of this will be that user ranked 5N+2 should accure yield from now upon according to Tier 3 which is 20% but he accures yield according to Tier 2 which is 35%.
so every time when a staker removed from Tier 3 of tiering system when total number of stakers before =10N+5, tier of user ranked 5N+2 was not updated correctly. which will cause discrepancy in tiering system as no of users whose tier is not properly updated increases eventually.



### Root Cause

In above case old_t1 + old_t2 = 5N+2 and new_t1 + new_t2 = 5N+1,
if we use old_t1 + old_t2  in place of  new_t1 + new_t2 in,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L894-L895
```solidity
            else if (isRemoval) {
                _findAndRecordTierChange(new_t1 + new_t2, n);
```
then it will try to modify tier of 5N+2, so that tier of 5N+2 will change to tier 3 from tier2.so that updating of tiers will be correct.
so the root cause was using new_t1 + new_t2 in place of  old_t1 + old_t2.


### Internal Pre-conditions

Total number of users in tiering system before removing a  staker from Tier 3 of tiering system should be in form of 10N+5 where N = natural number.



### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

A staker who is in Tier 3 of tiering system will  unstakes such that his balance become < minimum amount, when 10N+5 users where present in tiering system.

### Impact

1)breaks core invarient (Tier distribution correctness: Exactly 20% in Tier 1, 30% in Tier 2, and 50% in Tier 3).
2) As users not changing to tier 3 from tier 2, now upon they will get yield of 35% instead of 20%( protocol should give more yield than required to users).
3) total users in tier 2 will be more than actual and total users in tier 3 will be less than actual(discrepancy in tiering system).


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

use 
```solidity
            else if (isRemoval) {
                _findAndRecordTierChange(old_t1 + old_t2, n);
```
in place of 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L894-L895
```solidity
            else if (isRemoval) {
                _findAndRecordTierChange(new_t1 + new_t2, n);
```
