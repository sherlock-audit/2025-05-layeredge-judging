# `UNSTAKE_WINDOW` Serves No Purpose as User Is Removed Immediately

### Finding Description

The protocol enforces an unstaking waiting period (`UNSTAKE_WINDOW`) of 7 days before tokens are transferred back to the user. However, the user’s stake balance and tier status are updated immediately at the time of the unstake request, effectively removing them from the system before the waiting period elapses. This means the user cannot re-stake or participate during the waiting window, making the delay period functionally pointless and providing no real benefit such as security or economic deterrence found in other protocols. The unstaking delay should ideally prevent immediate exit, but here it only delays token withdrawal after the user is already out of the system.

Also according to the docs in `edgen-staking/docs/LayerEdgeStaking.md`, the expected flow is:

"1. User calls `unstake(amount)` function
2. **Contract checks** that user has sufficient stake and **the unstaking window (7 days) has passed**
3. Contract updates any pending interest
4. User's balance is reduced and staking details updated
5. User is marked as having unstaked, which permanently downgrades them to Tier 3
6. Tier boundaries are checked and updated if necessary
7. Tokens are transferred back to the user"

This indicates a mismatch between the intended design and the implementation.

### Root Cause

The protocol updates the user’s stake balance, tier status, and removes them from the staking tree immediately when `unstake()` is called. This premature state change occurs before the `UNSTAKE_WINDOW` delay period, which only controls when the actual token withdrawal happens.

### Impact

Unstaking windows typically delay withdrawal to prevent immediate exit, but here it serves no purpose since users are removed from the system immediately on unstake. This locks users out during the waiting period with no practical benefit.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider introducing a waiting period after the user calls `_unstake()` during which they remain active and can cancel their unstake request. Only after this period ends can the user confirm the unstake to actually remove their stake and exit.
