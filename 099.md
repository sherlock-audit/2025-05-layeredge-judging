# Protocol unfairly prioritizes early stakers over larger stakeholders in tier assignments

### Summary

The staking contract uses join order (via Fenwick Tree ranks) rather than stake size to determine tier eligibility.
This causes unfair APY distribution as early stakers with small balances maintain Tier 1/2 status, while larger latecomers remain in Tier 3.
Late-joining stakers with significant deposits.
The protocol’s ranking system will persistently favor early participants regardless of stake value.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L476

The Fenwick Tree tracks user counts (not stake amounts), so tiers are assigned based on join time (FCFS).

Example:

UserA joins early with 1 ETH → Tier 1 (top 20%)

UserB joins later with 100 ETH → Tier 3 (bottom 50%)

No rebalancing occurs when stake sizes change (compounding/unstaking).

### Internal Pre-conditions

Admin enables tiered rewards with fixed percentages (20%/30%/50%).

Users stake tokens over time, with later stakers depositing larger amounts.

The Fenwick Tree only increments/decrements counts (not stake values).

### External Pre-conditions

Protocol markets tiers as "competitive" or "stake-based" (implied fairness).

Late adopters expect proportional rewards for larger stakes.

### Attack Path

Phase 1 (Early):

First 20 users stake 1 ETH each → All assigned Tier 1 (20% quota filled).

Phase 2 (Late):

User21 stakes 100 ETH → Automatically Tier 3 (despite largest stake).

Result:

User21 earns Tier3 APY (e.g., 10%) on 100 ETH ($10/yr at 10% APY).

User1 earns Tier1 APY (e.g., 50%) on 1 ETH ($0.50/yr).

Systemic unfairness: User21 contributes 100x more capital but receives 20x less reward value.

### Impact

Late stakers lose 60-80% of potential APY (Tier1/2 vs. Tier3 rates).

Protocol faces reputation damage as tier system appears rigged for early users.

Financial Impact: For 100 ETH staked:

Tier1 APY (50%) → $50/yr

Tier3 APY (10%) → $10/yr

$40 annual opportunity cost per 100 ETH.

### Mitigation

Stake-Weighted Fenwick Tree:
Modify the tree to track cumulative stake amounts instead of user counts:
```solidity
function _stake(uint256 amount, address userAddr) internal {
    // Update tree with stake amount (not +1)
    stakerTree.update(user.joinId, int256(amount));
}
```

Tier Assignment by Stake Rank:
Redefine _computeTierByRank to use stake value percentiles:
```solidity
function _computeTierByRank(uint256 rank, uint256 totalStaked) internal pure returns (Tier) {
    if (rank <= totalStaked * 20 / 100) return Tier.Tier1; // Top 20% by stake
    else if (rank <= totalStaked * 50 / 100) return Tier.Tier2; // Next 30%
    else return Tier.Tier3;
}
```
