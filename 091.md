# Users Permanently Locked into Tier 3 if Initial Stake is Below Minimum

### Summary
The `_stake` function's current logic permanently assigns users to Tier 3 if their initial stake is below `minStakeAmount`, even if subsequent stakes increase their total balance above this minimum. This prevents them from entering the `stakerTree` and achieving a fair tier ranking. This behavior is detrimental to user experience and incentives. The recommendation is to modify `_stake` to allow users to enter the `stakerTree` if their cumulative stake meets the `minStakeAmount`, thereby ensuring fair tier progression.

### Brief Description
Users who make an initial stake amount less than `minStakeAmount` are permanently assigned to Tier 3 and marked as `outOfTree`. Subsequent stakes, even if they bring the total balance above `minStakeAmount`, do not allow the user to enter the tiered ranking system (`stakerTree`) or achieve a better tier. This is unfair and disincentivizes users who start small.

### Internal Pre-conditions
- `minStakeAmount` is set to a value greater than 0.
- A user (`userAddr`) has not staked before (i.e., `users[userAddr].isActive` is `false`).

### External Pre-conditions
- A user calls `stake()` or `stakeNative()` with an `amount` that is less than `minStakeAmount` for their very first deposit.

### Scenario Description
1.  Alice (a new user, `users[Alice].isActive == false`) stakes an `initial_amount < minStakeAmount`.
2.  Inside `_stake` ([`L691-L696`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L691-L696)):
    *   `user.isActive` becomes `true`.
    *   `user.outOfTree` becomes `true`.
    *   Alice is assigned Tier 3.
    *   Alice is *not* given a `joinId` and is *not* added to the `stakerTree`.
3.  Later, Alice stakes an `additional_amount` such that her new `user.balance` (initial_amount + additional_amount) is now `>= minStakeAmount`.
4.  When this second `_stake` call occurs:
    *   The condition `!user.isActive` ([`L691-L699`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L691-L699)) is now `false` because Alice is already active.
    *   The logic blocks that would assign a `joinId` and add her to the `stakerTree` are skipped.
5.  Subsequently, when `getCurrentTier(Alice_address)` is called:
    *   The check `if (user.outOfTree)` ([`L358`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L358)) evaluates to `true`.
    *   The function immediately returns `Tier.Tier3`, regardless of Alice's current total balance.

### Impact
- **Unfair Tier Assignment:** Users are permanently penalized for a small initial stake. Even if they later increase their stake significantly to meet or exceed requirements for higher tiers, they remain locked in Tier 3. This contradicts the general expectation of a fair system where current stake size (and potentially entry order for those above minimum) influences tier and rewards.
- **Reduced User Incentive & Participation:** Users who start with small amounts (e.g., to test the protocol) and later wish to commit more funds are disincentivized. Knowing they can never achieve a better APY tier, they might refrain from further staking or withdraw their funds, negatively impacting the protocol's Total Value Locked (TVL).
- **Inconsistent User Experience:** The protocol offers a tiered APY system, but this specific logic creates a hidden permanent penalty for a subset of users, leading to an inconsistent and potentially frustrating experience.

---

### Mitigation
Modify the `_stake` function to allow users who were initially `outOfTree` (due to a small first deposit) to enter the `stakerTree` if their total balance subsequently meets or exceeds `minStakeAmount`.

**Suggested Logic Change in `_stake`:**

After `_updateInterest(userAddr);` and token transfer, and before updating `user.balance`:

```solidity
// ... (previous _stake logic up to token transfer)

Tier currentTierBeforeStake = getCurrentTier(userAddr); // Get tier before this stake operation

// Staking for the first time
if (!user.isActive) {
    if (amount < minStakeAmount) {
        stakerCountOutOfTree++;
        user.outOfTree = true;
        _recordTierChange(userAddr, Tier.Tier3);
        // user.isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake remains false (default)
    } else { // amount >= minStakeAmount
        user.joinId = nextJoinId++;
        stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1);
        stakerAddress[user.joinId] = userAddr;
        stakerCountInTree++;
        user.isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake = true;
        // Tier will be calculated and recorded below
    }
    user.isActive = true;
} else { // User is already active, this is an additional stake
    // Check if user was outOfTree due to small initial deposit and can now enter the tree
    if (user.outOfTree && !user.isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake && (user.balance + amount) >= minStakeAmount) {
        user.outOfTree = false;
        stakerCountOutOfTree--; 

        user.joinId = nextJoinId++;
        stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1);
        stakerAddress[user.joinId] = userAddr;
        stakerCountInTree++;
        user.isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake = true; // Now their 'qualifying' deposit is >= minStakeAmount
    }
}

// Update user balances (must be after potential tree entry)
user.balance += amount;
user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;

// Update total staked
totalStaked += amount;

// Determine and record tier if it changed or if user just entered the tree
Tier newTier = getCurrentTier(userAddr);
if (newTier != currentTierBeforeStake || (user.isActive && user.joinId != 0 && stakerTierHistory[userAddr].length == 0)) {
    _recordTierChange(userAddr, newTier);
}

// If a user entered/left the tree, or if boundaries might shift due to rank changes (even for existing users)
// This check might need refinement to only run when necessary.
if ( ( !user.outOfTree && user.joinId != 0 /* was added or already in tree */ ) ) {
    _checkBoundariesAndRecord(false); // `false` because it's a stake operation
}

emit Staked(userAddr, amount, newTier);
```

**Explanation of Recommendation:**
1.  If a user is already active (`user.isActive == true`) but was previously `outOfTree` *and* their initial deposit was indeed less than the minimum (`!user.isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake`), check if their new total balance (`user.balance + amount`) now meets or exceeds `minStakeAmount`.
2.  If so, transition them into the tree: set `user.outOfTree = false`, assign `joinId`, update `stakerTree`, adjust counts, and mark `user.isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake = true`.
3.  The tier calculation and boundary checks will then correctly place them.

This ensures that users are not permanently disadvantaged by a small initial stake.
