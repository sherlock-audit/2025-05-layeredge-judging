# Uncapped APY Rate Update

### Summary

The smart contract allows the owner to arbitrarily increase the APY (Annual Percentage Yield) for any tier without any upper bounds or time locks. This may lead to extreme and unmanageable reward liabilities or malicious manipulation.



### Root Cause

The functions updateTierAPY and updateAllAPYs allow the owner to set any APY value, including extremely high values, without validation or capping. There are no constraints on the maximum APY values nor any governance/multisig/time-delay mechanism.

```solidity
function updateTierAPY(Tier tier, uint256 rate) external onlyOwner {
    ...
    // No limit check on `rate`
}
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol?#L272
```solidity
function updateAllAPYs(uint256 _tier1APY, uint256 _tier2APY, uint256 _tier3APY) external onlyOwner {
    ...
    // No limit check on `rate`
}
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

The owner must call updateTierAPY or updateAllAPYs.

The staking system is active and users have deposited funds.

### External Pre-conditions

Malicious or compromised owner.

An attacker convinces or exploits the owner/admin wallet.



### Attack Path

1. Owner calls updateTierAPY(Tier.Tier1, 10_000 * PRECISION) setting APY to 10,000% APR.
2. A user stakes a small amount.
3. After a short time (e.g., seconds), the user claims interest.
4. The reward amount is massively inflated due to high APY.
5. Contract quickly drains the rewardsReserve.







### Impact

Severity: High

Massive over-rewarding causes unsustainable depletion of rewardsReserve.

Undermines integrity of staking mechanism.

Potential for rug-pull scenario by malicious owner or exploit of compromised admin key.



### PoC

```solidity
// Called by contract owner
staking.updateTierAPY(Tier.Tier1, 10_000 * 1e18); // sets 10,000% APY

// Attacker stakes
staking.stake(1 ether);

// Wait 1 block or short time
// Attacker calls
staking.claimInterest();

// Contract pays ~> large interest, draining reserves.

```

### Mitigation

1. Cap the Maximum APY:

```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_APY = 100 * PRECISION; // max 100% annual

require(rate <= MAX_APY, "APY too high");
```
2. Add Time Locks or Delay Mechanisms:
- Implement a delay for APY changes.
- Store pending APY changes that activate after X blocks or time.

3. Use Governance / Multisig:
- Require APY changes to be approved by DAO vote or multisig wallet.

4.Emit warnings or trigger circuit breakers on large APY changes.
