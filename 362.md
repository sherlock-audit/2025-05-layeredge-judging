# Users who have unstaked and left the fenwick tree still count towards the total the MAX_USER

### Summary

When users who were previously staked on the fenwink tree leaves (unstakes and their balance is less than the minAmount), they don't free up space for others to join. This means that once a member who was previously active leaves, the total Active members cannot get to the MAX_USER of 100,000,000.

### Root Cause

The root cause is that the user's join ID is used as the index when updating the tree, and when that user leaves, the join ID remains vacant forever, and when subsequent users stake, they increase the join ID count. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/library/FenwickTree.sol#L10

```solidity
    function update(Tree storage self, uint256 index, int256 delta) internal {
        require(index > 0, "Index must be > 0");
@->        while (index <= self.size) {
            self.data[index] = uint256(int256(self.data[index]) + delta);
            index += lsb(index);
        }
    }
```

New users always increase the Join ID count,

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L701

```solidity
    function _stake(uint256 amount, address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
...

        // If first time staking, register staker position whose stake is more than minStakeAmount
        if (!user.isActive && amount >= minStakeAmount) { //@audit joinId can be exploited
@->            user.joinId = nextJoinId++;
```

Assuming 100,000,000 people join the system and they all unstake, no new person will be allowed to join the Fenwick tree. So everyone will be on tier 3.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. 100,000,000 people stake and unstake.
2. Just one unstake would actually reduce the MAX_USER count, but 100,000,000 users unstaking will close down the system.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

It is not feasible for one entity to perform this attack given the mean stake amount, so mass adoption is the main reason this will occur.

### Impact

1. The system will accommodate fewer stake than it was designed to accommodate.
2. In the worst-case scenario, everyone will remain on Tier 3 as no new staker will make it to the tree.

### PoC

Will provide upon request.

### Mitigation

Increase the limit to reflect the people that are unstaking
