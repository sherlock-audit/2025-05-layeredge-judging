# Tier System Race Condition

# Summary
The lack of transaction ordering protection in [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L644-L708](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L644-L708) will cause unfair tier distribution for stakers as attackers can manipulate transaction ordering to gain higher tier positions.

## Root Cause
In [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L644-L708](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L644-L708) the tier assignment mechanism processes updates sequentially without transaction ordering protection:

```solidity
function _checkBoundariesAndRecord(bool isRemoval) internal {
    // recompute thresholds
    uint256 n = stakerCountInTree;
    uint256 oldN = isRemoval ? n + 1 : n - 1;
    
    // Sequential processing allows race conditions
    if (new_t1 != old_t1) {
        for (uint256 rank = old_t1 + 1; rank <= new_t1; rank++) {
            _findAndRecordTierChange(rank, n);  // @audit Can be manipulated by tx ordering
        }
    }
}
```

This allows race conditions during concurrent staking operations. The vulnerability is further compounded in [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L481-L484](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L481-L484):

```solidity
if (!user.isActive && amount >= minStakeAmount) {
    user.joinId = nextJoinId++;
    stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1);
    // @audit Tier assignment depends on transaction order
}
```

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. Contract must have active stakers to establish tier boundaries
2. Multiple users must be attempting to stake simultaneously
3. Tier boundaries must be close to transition points

## External Pre-conditions
1. Network must be congested enough to allow transaction reordering
2. MEV infrastructure must be available to manipulate transaction order

## Attack Path
1. Attacker monitors mempool for incoming stake transactions
2. When victim attempts to stake, attacker front-runs with their own stake transaction
3. Attacker's transaction gets processed first, securing higher tier position
4. Victim's transaction processes after, getting lower tier despite timing
5. Attacker can then back-run with unstake if desired

## Impact
The stakers suffer unfair tier distribution and potential loss of higher APY rewards. Attackers can manipulate their position in the tier system, gaining unearned access to higher APY tiers while forcing legitimate users into lower tiers.

        staking.stake{value: STAKE_AMOUNT}();
        
        // Verify tier assignments
        assertEq(uint(staking.getUserTier(users[0])), uint(Tier.Tier1));
        assertEq(uint(staking.getUserTier(users[1])), uint(Tier.Tier2));
        
        // Attacker can now unstake
        vm.prank(users[0]);
        staking.unstake(STAKE_AMOUNT);
    }
}
```

## Mitigation
1. Implement commit-reveal scheme for staking operations in [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L481](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L481):

```solidity
struct StakeCommitment {
    bytes32 commitment;
    uint256 timestamp;
}

mapping(address => StakeCommitment) public stakeCommitments;

function commitStake(bytes32 commitment) external {
    stakeCommitments[msg.sender] = StakeCommitment({
        commitment: commitment,
        timestamp: block.timestamp
    });
}

function revealStake(uint256 amount, bytes32 salt) external {
    bytes32 commitment = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, amount, salt));
    require(stakeCommitments[msg.sender].commitment == commitment, "Invalid commitment");
    require(block.timestamp >= stakeCommitments[msg.sender].timestamp + 1 minutes, "Too early");
    // Process stake...
}
```

2. Add minimum stake duration before tier assignment
3. Implement batch processing for tier assignments
4. Consider using a fair sequencing system
