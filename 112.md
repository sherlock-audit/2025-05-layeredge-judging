# WETH9 withdraw is not compatible with smart accounts

### Summary

WETH9 unwraps native tokens using transfer(), which limits gas to 2300, which may cause withdrawals to fail.

### Root Cause

The WETH9 implementation [uses transfer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/WETH9.sol#L29) to unwrap native tokens for a `msg.sender`. If users attempt to withdraw funds using a Smart Wallet with any extra logic on the receive method, the transaction will run out of gas and fail. Users would then need to transfer the WETH to an EOA to unwrap their funds.

The `transfer()` only provides 2300 gas for its operation. This means the following cases can cause the transfer to fail:
* The contract's callback spends more than 2300 gas (which is only enough to emit something)
* The contract is called through a proxy, which itself uses up the 2300 gas
* complex operations or external calls


### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

Usage of a smart account or other additional logic is run which consumes more than 2300 gas.

### Attack Path

1. User initiates native token unwrap from the smart contract account.
2. WETH9 attempts to send native tokens via the `transfer` call.
3. Smart contract (recipient) invokes the callback function that consumes more than 2300 gas.
4. `transfer` call reverts with "out of gas" error.

### Impact

This could happen, for example, if the recipient is a smart account whose fallback function logic causes the execution to use more than 2300 gas.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider using `address.call{value: amount}("")`.
