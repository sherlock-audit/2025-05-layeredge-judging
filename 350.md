# The stake() method allows for potential asset lock-up issues caused by accidental transfers of native tokens

### Summary

The stake() function is designed to allow users to deposit ERC20 staking tokens. However, it does not reject unexpected ETH (msg.value) sent alongside the transaction. Since the _stake() method only wraps ETH via IWETH.deposit() when isNative == true, any ETH sent via the stake() function will be ignored and not converted, causing it to be permanently locked in the contract.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L161

This issue stems from a missing require(msg.value == 0) check in the stake() function, which made it possible for users to mistakenly or maliciously send ETH in their ERC20 stake call.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A user accidentally sends ETH (msg.value) along with the stake() function call.

### External Pre-conditions

A user mistakenly sent an unexpected ETH (msg.value) along with the call to the stake() function.

### Attack Path

1.A user mistakenly sent an unexpected ETH (msg.value) along with the call to the stake() function.
2.Any ETH sent via the stake() function will be ignored and not converted, causing it to be permanently locked in the contract.

### Impact

If a user makes a mistake in calling the stake() function, or this happens accidentally due to a UI wallet configuration error (for example, sending ETH via MetaMask), Any ETH sent via the stake() function will be ignored and not converted, causing it to be permanently locked in the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Reject unexpected native tokens in stake()
