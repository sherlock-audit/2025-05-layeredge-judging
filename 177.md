# Missing UUPS initialization in LayerEdgeStaking leads to broken upgrade functionality

## Description
The `LayerEdgeStaking` contract inherits from [`UUPSUpgradeable`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L18-L23) along with other upgradeable contracts (`OwnableUpgradeable`, `PausableUpgradeable`, `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable`). 

While it properly initializes the other parent contracts and includes the required `_authorizeUpgrade` function, its not calling `__UUPSUpgradeable_init()` in its [`initialize`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L129) function.

## Impact
**Upgrade Functionality Broken**: Contract cannot be upgraded

## Recommended Fix
1. Add UUPS initialization:
   ```solidity
   function initialize(address _stakingToken, address _admin) public initializer {
       __Ownable_init(_admin);
       __Pausable_init();
       __ReentrancyGuard_init();
       __UUPSUpgradeable_init();  // Add this line
       // ... rest of initialization
   }
   ```
