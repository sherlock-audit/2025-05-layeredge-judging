# `stakerCountInTree` Can Exceed Fenwick Tree Capacity, Breaking Tier Ratio Calculations

### Summary

When the Fenwick Tree is full, new stakers’ `joinId` exceed its size, so updates to the tree are ignored but `stakerCountInTree` is still incremented. This desynchronizes the count from the actual tree data, causing incorrect tier percentage calculations and tier assignments.

### Root Cause

The Fenwick Tree has a fixed maximum size, and when new users’ `joinId` exceed this size, the tree update silently skips without reverting. However, the protocol still increments `stakerCountInTree`, causing a mismatch between the actual tracked users in the tree and the count used for tier calculations.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The Fenwick Tree size is fixed at a maximum `(MAX_USERS)`. e.g., 100,000,000, and cannot be increased at runtime.

User `joinId` values increase monotonically without resetting or cycling, eventually exceeding `MAX_USERS`.

The `stakerCountInTree` increments for every new staker above `minStakeAmount` regardless of whether they fit inside the Fenwick Tree bounds.

The Fenwick Tree update method silently ignores updates where `index > MAX_USERS` instead of reverting.

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Because `stakerCountInTree` can become larger than the actual number of users tracked in the Fenwick Tree, the tier boundaries will be miscalculated. This results in users being incorrectly assigned to tiers, which breaks the intended distribution percentages and causes rewards to be unfairly distributed.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider reverting the entire transaction if a Fenwick Tree update is attempted with an index greater than the tree’s maximum size. Alternatively, users with `joinId` exceeding the Fenwick Tree capacity can be placed outside the tree and accounted for separately to maintain accurate tier calculations.
