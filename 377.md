# Precision rounding will under-reward early stakers

### Summary

The use of floor division in [`getTierCountForStakerCount()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L480C14-L480C40) will cause a systematic under-rewarding of early stakers, as tier thresholds fail to round up precisely. This leads to situations where whale stakers who deserve Tier 1 rewards are left in Tier 2, especially when new users join with min stakes and inflate the staker count.

### Root Cause

In [LayerEdgeStaking.sol:getTierCountForStakerCount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L480C14-L480C40), tier boundaries are calculated using integer division `((stakerCount * percentage) / 100)` and this actually causes rounding errors, preventing timely tier promotions for eligible users.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- `stakerCountInTree` is in a range where tier boundaries round down (e.g., 3–1000).
- A user is staked with a `joinId` close to the tier 1 boundary.


### Attack Path

- Honest staker A joins early and receives rank 10.

- Many small stakers join later, inflating the count to 49.
 
- Tier 1 boundary becomes **`(49 * 20) / 100 = 9.8 → 9`**.
 
- Staker A is stuck in Tier 2 instead of being in Tier 1.
 
- Staker A loses 15% APY relative to their rightful tier.

### Impact

Early stakers suffer a loss of expected yield, which can exceed 0.01% and $10 depending on deposit size.  


### Mitigation

Use ceil division or round up when computing tier boundaries
