# Setting minStakeAmount to type(uint256).max Disrupts Core Staking, Tiering, and Reward Logic

### Summary

Setting the minStakeAmount to type(uint256).max in file https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L334 effectively disables the tier-based staking and reward system. Because no practical stake can meet this astronomical minimum, users are not correctly registered in the Fenwick tree (stakerTree). This results in stakerCountInTree being zero, leading to incorrect tier assignments (typically all users defaulting to Tier 3), skewed interest calculations, and unexpected behavior in unstaking logic. The contract lacks input validation on setMinStakeAmount to prevent such a disruptive configuration.

### Root Cause

1. The primary issue stems from minStakeAmount being used as the threshold for inclusion in the stakerTree in the _stake function (if (!user.isActive && amount >= minStakeAmount)). When minStakeAmount is type(uint256).max, this condition is virtually impossible for any practical stake amount to satisfy.

2. This leads to stakerCountInTree remaining 0 (or very low if a user stakes type(uint256).max).

3. The tier calculation logic in getTierCountForStakerCount and _computeTierByRank heavily relies on stakerCountInTree. If this count is 0, tier assignments are skewed, typically resulting in all users being assigned to Tier 3 or not being tiered correctly.
 
4. The _unstake function also uses minStakeAmount to determine if a user should be removed from the tree (if (!user.outOfTree && user.balance < minStakeAmount)). With minStakeAmount at type(uint256).max, any unstake will likely trigger this removal.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The LayerEdgeStaking contract is deployed.


### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The contract owner (deployer in this log) calls setMinStakeAmount() with type(uint256).max.

### Impact

1. Stakers Not Added to Fenwick Tree / Incorrect Tiering:
         Users staking amounts less than type(uint256).max are not being correctly added to the stakerTree because the condition amount >= minStakeAmount in _stake is not met.
This results in stakerCountInTree being 0 or unexpectedly low.
Consequently, getTierCounts() returns incorrect tier distributions (e.g., 0 stakers in Tier 1 and Tier 2).
Failing tests like test_LayerEdgeStaking_TierSystem_MultipleStakers() (expected 2 in Tier 1, got 0) and test_LayerEdgeStaking_TierSystem_OneStaker() (expected 1 in Tier 1, got 0) confirm this.
Other tests like test_LayerEdgeStaking_InterestCalculation_WithTierShift() and test_LayerEdgeStaking_Pause_ViewFunctionsWork() fail assertions where users are expected to be in Tier 1 but are found in Tier 3 (likely the default or due to not being in the tree).

2. Incorrect Interest Calculations:
         Due to incorrect tiering (users defaulting to Tier 3 or not being considered active for higher tiers), the APY applied is not as expected for their stake amounts relative to other (hypothetical) stakers.
This leads to discrepancies in calculated interest, causing failures in:
test_LayerEdgeStaking_BalanceTracking_MultipleTiers(): FAIL: Tier 1 interest should be greater than Tier 2 (likely because all effective APYs are the same Tier 3 rate).
Multiple assertApproxEqAbs failures in interest calculation tests (e.g., test_LayerEdgeStaking_InterestCalculation_WithDifferentTierChanges, test_LayerEdgeStaking_Interest_APYUpdatesAndZeroRate, test_LayerEdgeStaking_Interest_BasicAccrual, etc.), where actual accrued interest significantly deviates from expected values.

3. Fenwick Tree and Staker Management Issues:
          test_LayerEdgeStaking_FenwickTree_PartialUnstaking() and test_LayerEdgeStaking_FenwickTree_ShouldNotOverflowUnderflow() fail with Balance should remain above minimum stake. If minStakeAmount is type(uint256).max, any user with less than this amount (i.e., all users in the tests) will fail this check if it's asserted after an operation that might remove them from the tree.
test_LayerEdgeStaking_MultiplePartialStakeAndUnstake_WithCompletion() fails with User should not be out of tree. Users are likely marked outOfTree because their balance is always less than type(uint256).max.
test_LayerEdgeStaking_StakeAndUnstakeVariations() fails with Alice should be in the tree.

4. Event Emission Mismatches:
            test_LayerEdgeStaking_Unstake_Basic() fails with log != expected log, likely due to incorrect TierChanged event parameters or missing/unexpected events related to tiering.

### PoC

In file https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/test/stake/LayerEdgeStakingTest.t.sol#L67

Add the following entry
```Solidity
uint256 public constant MALICIOUS_STAKE = type(uint256).max; 
staking.setMinStakeAmount(MALICIOUS_STAKE);
```


### Mitigation

1. Input Validation for setMinStakeAmount: Implement robust checks in the setMinStakeAmount function to prevent setting it to type(uint256).max or other unreasonably large values that would break the tiering logic. Consider establishing a sensible maximum for minStakeAmount relative to total supply or other system parameters.
2. Graceful Handling of Zero/Low Stakers in Tree: While the primary fix is input validation, ensure that tier calculation and interest logic handle scenarios with zero or very few stakers in the tree without reverting or producing wildly incorrect results (e.g., by defaulting all stakers to Tier 3 APY if the tree-based tiering cannot be applied).

Example in the code:
```Solidity
function setMinStakeAmount(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        // Prevent setting an impractically high minimum stake amount.
        // Consider defining a more dynamic MAX_MIN_STAKE_AMOUNT if needed.
        require(amount > 0 && amount < type(uint256).max / 2, "Invalid min stake amount"); // Example upper bound
        minStakeAmount = amount;
```
