# Missing EIP Compliance Checks

### Summary

While the contract states compliance with UUPS, ERC-20, and WETH9 specs, it doesn’t validate storage slots or token hook behaviour.

### Root Cause

Reliance solely on OpenZeppelin inheritance without explicit slot verification.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Proxy upgrade performed via UUPS.

### External Pre-conditions

Implementation or proxy library is updated outside the repo.

### Attack Path

A mismatched implementation could shift storage slots, leading to corrupted state on upgrade.

### Impact

Critical: could completely break contract invariants or allow unauthorized admin control.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

• Add assert(_getImplementation() == IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT) checks.
• Include automated tests that deploy proxy + implementation and verify storage.
