# WETH9::approve Race Condition Allows Double-Spend

### Summary

The WETH9 contract implements the original ERC-20 approve() function without addressing the well-known race condition. This can lead to a **double-spend** of allowances if a user attempts to change an existing allowance without first resetting it to zero.


### Root Cause

The approve() function in WETH9 allows an owner to set a spender’s allowance by directly assigning the new value:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/WETH9.sol#L37-L41

However, this implementation does not prevent **allowance front-running**, where a malicious spender can exploit the window between allowance changes:
	* 	If a user sets a new allowance while the spender still has permission to spend the old amount,
	* 	The spender can quickly transferFrom() the old amount before the allowance is overwritten,
	* 	Then spend again using the new allowance, resulting in a **double-spend**.

This behavior is considered a known flaw in the ERC-20 standard and has led to real-world losses in past protocols.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user has previously approved a spender (spender) for a non-zero allowance.
2. The spender is not trusted and is able to monitor pending transactions in the mempool.
3. The user sends a new transaction to update the allowance without first setting it to zero.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1.	User approves attacker for 100 tokens.
2.	Later, the user wants to increase the allowance to 200 and sends an approve(attacker, 200) transaction.
3.	The attacker monitors the mempool, sees this new approval pending, and immediately calls transferFrom(user, ...) using the current 100-token allowance.
4.	Once the approval transaction is mined, the allowance becomes 200.
5.	The attacker calls transferFrom(user, ...) again, this time for 200 tokens.
6.	Total tokens drained: 300, despite the user intending to only authorize 200.

### Impact

unauthorized token transfers

        vm.prank(alice);

```

### Mitigation

 update the approve() logic to include a guard condition requiring the allowance to first be set to zero before being changed to a non-zero value, following the pattern used in OpenZeppelin’s modern ERC20 implementation:
