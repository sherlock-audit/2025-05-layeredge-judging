### Title:
`LayerEdgeStaking::withdrawRewards` trusts rewardsReserve without verifying actual token balance


## Severity:
Medium

Description

The LayerEdgeStaking::withdrawRewards function allows the contract owner to withdraw tokens from the reward pool. It relies solely on the internal rewardsReserve variable to determine how many tokens are available for withdrawal.

Here’s the function:
```solidity
function withdrawRewards(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    require(amount > 0, "Cannot withdraw zero amount");
    require(amount <= rewardsReserve, "Insufficient rewards");

    rewardsReserve -= amount;

    // Transfer tokens to admin
    require(stakingToken.transfer(owner(), amount), "Token transfer failed");
}
```
> **Line of code:**  
> [`LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L310`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L310)

The issue is that rewardsReserve is a manually maintained accounting variable that may not always match the actual stakingToken.balanceOf(address(this)).

Impact:

There are two possible mismatches that can lead to protocol problems:

Firstly: Understated rewardsReserve (actual balance > internal record):

If someone sends tokens directly to the contract (without calling depositRewards()), rewardsReserve won’t be updated.

These tokens become inaccessible through withdrawRewards or user claims.

This could result in Stuck funds and inefficient use of capital.

The second one is : 
Overstated rewardsReserve (internal record > actual balance):

If a bug or incorrect logic inflates rewardsReserve, the owner may attempt to withdraw tokens that don’t exist.

If this fails, it can cause unexpected reverts.

If it somehow succeeds (e.g., with a custom token), it could break reward availability for users.



Recommended mitigation 

To make the function more robust, add a balance check before proceeding with the withdrawal:

```solidity
require(stakingToken.balanceOf(address(this)) >= amount, "Insufficient actual balance");
```
Also, emit a transparency event for off-chain tracking:

emit RewardsWithdrawn(owner(), amount);
