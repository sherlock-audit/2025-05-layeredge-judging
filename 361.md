# Missing "slippage" protection against raise of minimum stake amount and number of previously staked users

### Summary

Since the state of the protocol can differ between the initiation of a stake transaction and its execution, we need some form of slippage protection. There are two scenarios where the state can change:

1. The admin raises the minimum stake amount after a user has initiated a transaction with the previous minimum stake amount. This results in the user being permanently excluded from the Fenwick tree, thus remaining in Tier 3 indefinitely.
2. A user observes few stakers and decides to stake early to secure a front position, but due to network congestion, their transaction is executed later, after other users have staked. This places the staker in an unfavorable position.

### Root Cause

Missing slippage protection in `stake()`/`stakeNative()` function.
Due to deployment on the Ethereum mainnet, periods of high congestion may occur, where the time between initiating and executing a transaction can span hours, plus a public mempool.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Admin raises the minimum stake.

### External Pre-conditions

Other users stake at the same time.

### Attack Path

1. User initiates a stake transaction.
2. One of described scenarios in Summary section happens
3. User get unexpected result - either permanently out of Fenwick tree or unfavorable position

### Impact

The loss of expected yield.

This loss occurs either because the user remains permanently in Tier 3 or because more than expected additional stakers must join after them to achieve promotion to a higher tier. For example, if there are only 10 stakers and a user tries to stake, they expect that only 11 more people need to join after them to be placed in Tier 2. However, if 100 other users stake between the initiation and execution of their transaction, the user must wait for 111 additional users to join to be in the top 50% and qualify for Tier 2.

Due to the protocol's design, which incentivizes competing for early spots, it is expected that many users will initially attempt to stake and secure the top positions.

Users funds will be locked for 7 days due to the timelock mechanism and users wont be able to unstake immediately if such scenario occurs.
### PoC

N/A
### Mitigation

Consider adding a slippage protection when staking to allow users transactions revert in unfavorable conditions of stake.
