# Simple interest calculation is slightly off

## Vulnerability Details

In LayerEdge, if user engages with protocol actively, it could lead to a lesser rewards being returned to them.

## POC

Consider the following simplistic scenario

1. Alice has a staked amount of `3000e18` since `timestamp = 1`.
2. If Alice regularly calls `claimInterest` at consistent intervals (for example, every 100 seconds) -
   - from `timestamp = 1 to timestamp = 401`, ultimately gathering `19025875190258748` in interest.
3. If she claims at `timestamp = 401`, she receives `19025875190258751`, resulting in a discrepancy of 3 wei compared to claiming at frequent intervals for the same 400 seconds window from timestamp = 1 to timestamp = 400.
4. Depending on the frequency of Alice's claims, she may also miss out on additional cumulative rewards.
5. This scenario can affect many stakers, potentially resulting in significant overall losses in rewards for users.

To run the test:

1. Add the below two tests into `LayerEdgeStakingTest.t.sol`
2. Run `forge test --mt test_singleClaim -vv`
3. Run `forge test --mt test_multipleClaims -vv`

Logs:

```bash
Logs:
  Alice's interest =  0
  Alice's interest claimed=  19025875190258751
```

```bash
[PASS] test_multipleClaims() (gas: 1063874)
Logs:
  Alice's interest =  0
  Alice's interest claimed=  19025875190258748
```

```solidity

        vm.startPrank(alice);

        // Alice stakes
        vm.warp(1);

        staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
        (uint256 balance,,uint256 interestEarned,,,,,,) = staking.users(alice);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Initial balance given to her = 100_000 e18
        // She stakes MIN_STAKE = 3000e18
        // current balance + amount staked - initial balance given to her = interest she claimed
        console2.log("Alice's interest claimed= ", token.balanceOf(alice) + MIN_STAKE - 100_000 * 1e18);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }

    function test_singleClaim() public {

        vm.startPrank(alice);

        // Alice stakes
        vm.warp(1);
        token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE);

        (uint256 balance,,uint256 interestEarned,,,,,,) = staking.users(alice);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.warp(401);
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        staking.claimInterest();
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Initial balance given to her = 100_000 e18
        // She stakes MIN_STAKE = 3000e18
        // current balance + amount staked - initial balance given to her = interest she claimed
        console2.log("Alice's interest claimed= ", token.balanceOf(alice) + MIN_STAKE - 100_000 * 1e18);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

## Root Cause

Interest calculation does not take into account high frequency interactions

## Impact

The below invariant breaks

> Interest calculation accuracy: User rewards must be calculated correctly based on their tier history, time staked, and APY rates

Cumulatively, this can result in a substantial loss of rewards for users

## Mitigation

Consider a minimum time window before which subsequent actions can be taken by users.
