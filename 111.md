# Native/Non-Native Token Mismatch in LayerEdgeStaking Contract

### Summary

The LayerEdgeStaking contract contains a critical vulnerability in its staking and unstaking mechanism where it fails to track and enforce consistency between native (ETH) and non-native (ERC20) token staking methods. This allows users to potentially exploit the contract by mismatching their staking and unstaking methods, which could lead to fund loss or manipulation of the staking system.


### Root Cause

The vulnerability stems from two main issues in the contract:

1. Lack of Staking Method Tracking: The contract does not store or track whether a user's stake was made using native ETH `stakeNative()` or ERC20 tokens `stake()`. This information is lost after the initial staking.

2. Unrestricted Unstaking Method Selection: The contract allows users to choose any unstaking method `completeUnstake()` or `completeUnstakeNative()` regardless of how they originally staked their tokens. This is evident in the `_completeUnstake()` function which takes an isNative parameter but doesn't validate it against the original staking method. Meaning the user can unstake with both `completeUnstake` and `completeUnstakeNative`

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The attacker has ERC20 tokens (LayerEdgeToken) to stake
- The contract has sufficient WETH balance (which it should have from other users' native staking)

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Stake ERC20 Tokens
2. Request Unstake
3. Wait for Unstaking Window
4. Exploit: Unstake as Native ETH


### Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is HIGH:
1. Fund Loss: The attacker receives native ETH instead of the ERC20 tokens they originally staked.

2. Contract Balance Imbalance: The contract's WETH balance is reduced, but the ERC20 token balance remains unchanged

3. System Integrity: The vulnerability undermines the integrity of the staking system, as it breaks the expected 1:1 relationship between staking and unstaking methods.

### PoC

1. When the attacker stakes ERC20 tokens:

      - ERC20 tokens are transferred to the contract
      - The contract converts these to WETH
      - The attacker's balance is recorded

2. When the attacker `unstakes` using `completeUnstakeNative()`:
       - The contract checks the unstake request exists and is valid
       - Since isNative is true, it executes the native unstaking path.
       - This converts WETH back to ETH and sends it to the attacker
       - The attacker receives native ETH instead of ERC20 tokens



```solidity 
function test_LayerEdgeStaking_NativeNonNativeMismatch() public {
        // send some token to LayerEdgeToken contract
        vm.deal(bob, MIN_STAKE);
        assertEq(address(bob).balance, MIN_STAKE);

        // Bob stakes natively 
        vm.startPrank(bob);
        staking.stakeNative{value: MIN_STAKE}();
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Initial setup - Alice stakes non-natively
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE);
        staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Queue unstake
        vm.prank(alice);
        staking.unstake(MIN_STAKE);

        // Advance time past unstaking window
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 7 days + 1);

        // // Try to complete unstake as native
        vm.prank(alice);
        staking.completeUnstakeNative(0);
    }
```

### Mitigation

* Track Staking Method
* Add Validation: Add explicit checks in the unstaking functions to ensure users can only use the method that matches their original staking method.
