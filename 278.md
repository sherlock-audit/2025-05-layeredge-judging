# Incorrect Tier Boundary Update on Staker Count Change Causes APY Miscalculation

### Summary

When the number of stakers changes, the `_checkBoundariesAndRecord `function is responsible for updating users' tier history to match their current ranking. However, in cases where the tier2 count remains unchanged but the tier1 count shifts (thus affecting the tier2 boundary), the function updates the **wrong boundary rank**. This results in stale tier history for some users, allowing them to receive APYs for tiers they no longer qualify for (or are prematurely upgraded to), leading to **incorrect reward distribution**.

### Root Cause

in  a situation where tier2 boundry shifts as a result of a shift tier1 rank only, the below code block is not used but the `else if` statements is used
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L876

However, In the final `else if` block of tier2 boundary handling:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L894-L898
The function updates the `new boundary` during removal, and the `old boundary` during addition — the reverse of what should be done. This leads to skipped or incorrect `stakerTierHistory` updates for the actual boundary staker whose tier has changed.

### Attack Path

1. A staker deposits to increase `n `(staker count) from 14 to 15.
2. `tier1 `increases from 2 → 3, `tier2 `stays at 4.
3. Tier2 boundary moves from rank 6 → 7.
4. `_checkBoundariesAndRecord` **wrongly call `_findAndRecordTierChange` on rank 6** instead of rank 7.
5. Rank 7 staker (new entrant to tier2) is not updated in tier history.
6. Rewards are calculated using the stale history: rank 7 still appears to be in tier3.
7. Conversely, on removal, a demoted staker retains tier2 status in history.

### Impact

**Incorrect reward distribution** — stakers may earn higher or lower rewards bacause the APYs used for interest calculation are calculated based on the `stakerTierHistory`.
**Inconsistent state** — `getCurrentTier` and  latest `stakerTierHistory` return contradictory values.

### PoC

paste in /edgen-staking/test/stake/LayerEdgeStakingTest.t.sol
```solidity
function test__checkBoundariesAndRecord_downgradingIssue() public {
        for (uint256 i = 1; i <= 15; i++) {
            address staker = makeAddr(string(abi.encodePacked("staker", i))); //staker 1 - 15
            vm.prank(admin);
            token.transfer(staker, MIN_STAKE);
            
            vm.startPrank(staker);
            token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE);
            staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
            vm.stopPrank();
        }
       
       address staker7 =  makeAddr(string(abi.encodePacked("staker", uint(7))));

       (,LayerEdgeStaking.Tier expectedTier,,, LayerEdgeStaking.TierEvent[] memory tierHistory) = staking.getAllInfoOfUser(staker7);

        LayerEdgeStaking.Tier lastUpdateTier = tierHistory[tierHistory.length -1].to; 

        // expectedTier is the tier calculated from rank using getCurrentTier, while lastUpdateTier is the last update of the tier history which will be used to get the apy for reward cal for the current period
        vm.assertLt(uint(expectedTier), uint(lastUpdateTier)); 

       
    }
```

### Mitigation

update the `_checkBoundariesAndRecord` function
```diff
- else if (isRemoval) {
-     _findAndRecordTierChange(new_t1 + new_t2, n);
- } else if (!isRemoval) {
-     _findAndRecordTierChange(old_t1 + old_t2, n);
- }

+ else if (isRemoval) {
+    _findAndRecordTierChange(old_t1 + old_t2, n); // downgrade the removed boundary staker
+ } else if (!isRemoval) {
+    _findAndRecordTierChange(new_t1 + new_t2, n); // upgrade the newly included staker
+ }
```
