# Users with Zero Delta Remain in Fenwick Tree and Occupy Slots

### Summary

When a user unstakes and their balance falls below `minStakeAmount`, they should be permanently removed from the tree. This is implemented by setting their Fenwick Tree delta to zero, so they are no longer counted in calculations. However, they still occupy a slot in the Fenwick Tree, which has a fixed maximum size of 100,000,000. As a result, these inactive slots might block new users indefinitely, even though they will effectively never be reused.

### Root Cause

The Fenwick Tree uses a fixed-size data structure with slots allocated to users upon staking. When users unstake below the minimum amount, their delta is set to zero, removing their weight from calculations but not freeing their slot. Because there is no mechanism to reclaim or recycle these zero-delta slots, they remain occupied indefinitely, reducing the pool of available positions for new stakers.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Users must have joined the Fenwick Tree and been assigned a slot `(joinId)`.

Users must have fully unstaked (or unstaked an amount causing them to fall below `minStakeAmount`), triggering their Fenwick Tree delta to be updated to zero.

The Fenwick Tree size is fixed and cannot dynamically expand or shrink.

There is no existing logic to reclaim or reuse slots with zero delta.

### Impact

Even though the Fenwick Tree is capped at 100,000,000 slots, over time many of these slots may be occupied by inactive users with zero delta who no longer participate. This means that, in practice, the tree could hold far fewer active stakers than its maximum capacity.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider implementing a system to reclaim or reuse Fenwick Tree slots occupied by inactive users
