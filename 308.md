# Loss of funds and broken invariant due to rounding down in `LayerEdgeStaking::getTierCountForStakerCount`

### Summary

The [`LayerEdgeStaking::getTierCountForStakerCount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L480) rounds down for both tier 1 and tier 2 cases, leading to loss of APY  to the ousted users and broken tier correctness invariant.

### Root Cause

The [`LayerEdgeStaking::getTierCountForStakerCount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L480) is used inside the [`_checkBoundariesAndRecord`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L841) which is used to adjust the tier distribution:
```solidity
    function getTierCountForStakerCount(uint256 stakerCount)
        public
        pure
        returns (uint256 tier1Count, uint256 tier2Count, uint256 tier3Count)
    {
        // Calculate tier 1 count (20% of active stakers)
        tier1Count = (stakerCount * TIER1_PERCENTAGE) / 100;              <<@ - // Rounds down

        // Ensure at least 1 staker in tier 1 if there are any active stakers
        if (tier1Count == 0 && stakerCount > 0) {
            tier1Count = 1;
        }

        // Calculate remaining stakers after tier 1
        uint256 remainingAfterTier1 = stakerCount > tier1Count ? stakerCount - tier1Count : 0;

        // Calculate tier 2 count (30% of total active stakers, but don't exceed remaining)
        uint256 calculatedTier2Count = (stakerCount * TIER2_PERCENTAGE) / 100;             <<@ - // Rounds down

        if (calculatedTier2Count == 0 && remainingAfterTier1 > 0) {
            tier2Count = 1;
        } else {
            tier2Count = calculatedTier2Count > remainingAfterTier1 ? remainingAfterTier1 : calculatedTier2Count;
        }

        // Tier 3 is everyone else
        tier3Count = stakerCount > (tier1Count + tier2Count) ? stakerCount - tier1Count - tier2Count : 0;

        return (tier1Count, tier2Count, tier3Count);
    }
```
As we can observe, in both the cases of tier 1 and tier 2, the tier count is rounded down, which is incorrect.

Let's take an example of 99 users, a dry run yields folllowing:
Tier 1 - (99 * 20) / 100 = 19   (rounds down in solidity)
Tier 2 - (99 * 30) / 100 = 29  (rounds down in solidity)
Tier 3 = 99 - 19 - 29 = 51

This is unfair as one user would get ousted from the deserving tier.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A few users need to stake via `stake` function.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Users simply perform normal stake and unstake operations and this issue would arise.

### Impact

1. Loss of APY for affected users as they get ousted from their deserving tiers.
2. `Tier distribution correctness` invariant mentioned in the readme is broken.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It is recommended to round up for Tier 2 to allow room for accommodating indivisible outliers.
