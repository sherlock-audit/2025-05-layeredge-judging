# Users can get locked out of the protocol due to gas limit issues

### Summary

The way the `_updateInterest` function is set up can cause users to run out of gas when they try to stake, unstake, or claim rewards. This means they might not be able to use the protocol.

### Root Cause

In [`LayerEdgeStaking.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L813), the `calculateUnclaimedInterest` function has nested loops that can use a lot of gas in some cases.

- The first loop goes through `userTierHistory`, which can get long as more users stake. The first user would always stay in Tier 1,  or go to Tier 3 once they unstake below Min stake amount, but as more users come into the protocol, and a user is on the edge of two Tiers, they will change Tiers often caused by other people staking/unstaking. Thus, this userTierHistory might become relatively large.
    
    ```solidity
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < userTierHistory.length; i++) {
        // Processing tier history
    }
    
    ```
    
- The second loop goes from `relevantStartIndex` (which might be 0, if the user has not done anything yet) to the end of `userTierHistory`, which can also be long:
    
    ```solidity
    for (uint256 i = relevantStartIndex; i < userTierHistory.length; i++) {
        // Processing tier changes
    }
    
    ```
    
- The second loop goes through `getTierAPYForPeriod` function which has another loop that checks `apyPeriods`. Here we have nested loop, which can also be really big, especially during volatile periods where the admin often changes the APY in shorter periods:
    
    ```solidity
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < apyPeriods.length; i++) {
        // Calculating APY for the period
    }
    
    ```

As the README states, the arrays are unbounded, so these loops might be really long and use all of the gas block limit.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Users need to have a long history of tier changes.
2. User must not be from the first stakers.
3. User must not have called any function triggering `_updateInterest()`

### External Pre-conditions

1. The number of active stakers needs to grow, making `userTierHistory` longer for many users.
2. The staking environment needs to be volatile, causing frequent changes to APY periods.

### Attack Path

After the external and internal conditions are met, user with long userTierHistory tries to call stake/unstake/claimInterest/compoundInterest, and the function reverts. 

### Impact

Users suffer loss of funds, because they are locked out of using the protocol's main functions.
