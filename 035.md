# Owner Lowering `minStakeAmount` Fails to Re-evaluate Tiers for Users Initially Below Minimum

### Summary

Users who initially stake an amount below the [prevailing ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L106)`minStakeAmount` are flagged as `outOfTree = true` and `isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake = false`, permanently placing them in Tier 3. If the contract owner subsequently lowers `minStakeAmount` via `setMinStakeAmount()`, these users are not re-evaluated. Even if their existing staked balance now meets or exceeds the new, lower `minStakeAmount`, the `getCurrentTier()` function will continue to return Tier 3 because it prioritizes the `outOfTree` flag. Consequently, these users remain locked out of potentially higher tiers and associated APYs they would otherwise qualify for under the updated conditions.

### Root Cause

1.  **Permanent `outOfTree` Status:** The `users[userAddr].outOfTree` flag, once set to `true` due to an initial stake below `minStakeAmount`, is never reset.
2.  **`getCurrentTier()` Logic:** The function checks `user.outOfTree` first and returns `Tier.Tier3` if true, bypassing checks against the current `minStakeAmount`.
    ```solidity
    // Simplified from getCurrentTier()
    if (user.outOfTree) {
        return Tier.Tier3; // Short-circuits further evaluation
    }
    ```
3.  **No Re-evaluation Mechanism:** `setMinStakeAmount()` only updates the threshold value; it doesn't trigger a re-assessment of existing users' tier eligibility, especially those marked `outOfTree`.
4.  **Persistent `isActive` Flag:** The `user.isActive` flag, set on the first deposit, is never reset. This prevents users who were initially `outOfTree` from potentially re-entering the tree logic in `_stake()` on subsequent deposits, as `_stake()` uses `!user.isActive` to determine first-time stakers eligible for tree placement.

### Internal Pre-conditions

*   A user (`userA`) has made their first stake (`stakeAmount_A`).
*   `stakeAmount_A < minStakeAmount` (at the time of `userA`'s stake).
*   As a result: `users[userA].outOfTree == true`, `users[userA].isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake == false`, and `users[userA].isActive == true`.

### External Pre-conditions

*   The contract owner calls `setMinStakeAmount(newMinStakeAmount)`.
*   The `newMinStakeAmount` is such that `users[userA].balance >= newMinStakeAmount`.

### Attack Path

1.  Initial `minStakeAmount` is 3000 tokens.
2.  Alice stakes 2000 tokens.
    *   Alice is marked `outOfTree = true`, `isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake = false`, `isActive = true`, and assigned Tier 3. She is not added to the `stakerTree`.
3.  Owner lowers `minStakeAmount` to 1500 tokens.
    *   Alice's current stake of 2000 tokens now exceeds the new `minStakeAmount`.
4.  Calling `getCurrentTier(Alice)` still returns Tier 3 because `users[Alice].outOfTree` is `true`.
5.  Alice remains in Tier 3 and `outOfTree`, unable to access higher tiers, even if she stakes more, due to her `isActive` status.

### Impact

*   **Unfair User Treatment:** Users who staked small amounts initially are permanently disadvantaged if `minStakeAmount` is lowered, unable to benefit from the policy change.
*   **Loss of Potential Rewards:** Affected users are stuck with Tier 3 APY, missing out on higher rates from Tier 1 or Tier 2 for which their stake might now qualify.
*   **Reduced System Flexibility:** The benefit of an adjustable `minStakeAmount` is undermined as it doesn't retroactively apply fairly to all users.
*   **User Dissatisfaction:** The system can be perceived as unfair by users who meet current criteria but are penalized for actions under previous, stricter rules.
