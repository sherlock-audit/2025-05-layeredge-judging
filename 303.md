# No oracle used for staking token valuation allows users to profit from stake/unstake

### Summary

No oracle used for staking token valuation allows users to profit from stake/unstake

### Root Cause

Users are allowed to stake with both the staking token and native eth, as well as unstake choosing which type arbitrarily. E.g. if Alice stakes with native she is then later allowed to [unstake](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L725-L755) using the staking token and no checks on token valuation are made:

```solidity
    function _unstake(uint256 amount, address userAddr) internal {
        UserInfo storage user = users[userAddr];

        // require(user.isActive, "No active stake");
        require(user.balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        // Update interest before changing balance
        _updateInterest(userAddr);

        // Update user balances
        user.balance -= amount;
        user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;

        // Update total staked
        totalStaked -= amount;

        if (!user.outOfTree && user.balance < minStakeAmount) {
            // execute this before removing from tree, this will make sure to calculate interest
            //for amount left after unstake
            _recordTierChange(userAddr, Tier.Tier3);
            stakerTree.update(user.joinId, -1);
            stakerCountInTree--;
            user.outOfTree = true;
            stakerCountOutOfTree++;
            _checkBoundariesAndRecord(true);
        }

        // Add unstake request instead of immediate transfer
        unstakeRequests[userAddr].push(UnstakeRequest({amount: amount, timestamp: block.timestamp, completed: false}));
    }
```

What this allows is for Alice to stake using native, create an unstake request and then after her cooldown period has passed, decide what to unstake with depending on the pricing of both the staking token vs native:

```solidity
    function completeUnstake(uint256 index) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        _completeUnstake(msg.sender, index, false);
    }

    function completeUnstakeNative(uint256 index) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        _completeUnstake(msg.sender, index, true);
    }
```

Since the staking token on mainnet (EDGEN) still doesn't have available price data, I don't know if it will be a pegged stable or if it will have a dynamic price. In any case, even if is a stable, a depeg in price will allow Alice to later profit. This will ultimately either disrupt the staking token's price or she will profitably arbitrage from staking/unstaking.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Alice times her withdrawals to profit, ultimately either disrupt the staking token's price or profiting from arbitrage

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement token valuation and price checks, using an oracle would be sufficient
