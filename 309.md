# User can split his funds to promote a part of them

## Description

A user who has a large amount of funds can split his funds into several accounts in order to promote some of them and get more benefits. This contradicts the assumption that, as the last person in queue, he should be assigned to Tier 3.

Also, the attacker filling the queue with many of his accounts, creates unfair conditions for new users.



## Impact

- Faster promotion for a participant who has more funds, which contradicts the condition: First-come-first-serve (FCFS) ordering
- Creating a longer queue can create unfair conditions for new users.



## Proof of concept

- The contract has 10 stakers
- The attacker creates 20 different accounts and deposits funds into each one
- Using each new account he stakes the funds
- 5 attacker's accounts have Tier 2, instead of being Tier 3.

## Recommended mitigation

The solution may be to use Stake-Based Fair Queue  where participant priority in a staking system is determined not solely by arrival order, but also by the size of the stake each participant commits.
