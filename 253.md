# Inadequate Interest Calculation for Different Token Types

### Summary
The `calculateUnclaimedInterest` function in the `LayerEdgeStaking` contract does not differentiate between interest calculations for native tokens and ERC20 staking tokens. This oversight can lead to inaccurate interest calculations, as the value of native tokens and ERC20 tokens are not equivalent. This can result in users receiving incorrect interest amounts, potentially leading to financial discrepancies and user dissatisfaction.

### Vulnerability Details
- **Root cause**:  No separation of logic for calculating native token interest and stake token(ERC20) interest
- **Components Affected**: `calculateUnclaimedInterest`, `_updateInterest`
- **Impact**: Users may receive incorrect interest amounts due to the lack of differentiation between native tokens and ERC20 tokens in interest calculations, leading to potential financial discrepancies.

### Exploit Scenario
1. **Staking with Different Tokens**:
   - A user stakes both ERC20 tokens and native tokens in the contract.

2. **Interest Calculation**:
   - The [calculateUnclaimedInterest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L397) function is called as part of the `_updateInterest` process.
   - The function does not account for the different values of native tokens and ERC20 tokens, leading to inaccurate interest calculations.

3. **Inaccurate Interest Distribution**:
   - Users may receive more or less interest than they are entitled to, depending on the relative values of the tokens at the time of calculation.

### Steps to Exploit
1. **Stake with Both Token Types**:
   - Stake a combination of ERC20 tokens and native tokens.

2. **Trigger Interest Calculation**:
   - Allow the contract to calculate interest through the `_updateInterest` function.

3. **Receive Inaccurate Interest**:
   - Due to the lack of differentiation in `calculateUnclaimedInterest`, receive an incorrect interest amount.

### Recommendations
Here, the fix is not only to track different types of token balances for the user. The logic of the [calculateUnclaimedInterest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L397) function also should be updated.

- **Separate Interest Calculations**: Implement distinct interest calculation logic for ERC20 tokens and native tokens to ensure accurate interest distribution.
- **Price Oracle Integration**: Use a price oracle to adjust interest calculations based on the current value of native tokens relative to ERC20 tokens.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Conduct thorough testing of interest calculation logic to ensure accuracy and fairness across different token types.

By addressing these issues, the protocol can ensure accurate and fair interest calculations, maintaining user trust and financial integrity.
