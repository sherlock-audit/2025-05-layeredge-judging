# _checkBoundariesAndRecord() does not work as intended

### Summary

When the previous number of stakers is equal to S = 5k − 1 (where k > 1 and odd), the next execution of `_checkBoundariesAndRecord()` fails to update tiers correctly.

### Root Cause

### Tier Calculation Rules

Tier 1 = nStakers \* 20 / 100 (floored)

Tier 2 = nStakers \* 30 / 100 (floored)

Tier 3 = Remaining stakers

**Let's use the following example: Stakers = 14 -- then new user stakes --> Stakers = 15**

**For S = 14:**
Tier 1: 14 \* 20 / 100 → 2.8 → 2

Tier 2: 14 \* 30 / 100 → 4.2 → 4 (old_t2)

Tier 3: 14 − (2 + 4) → 8

**For S = 15:**
Tier 1: 15 \* 20 / 100 → 3 → 3

Tier 2: 15 \* 30 / 100 → 4.5 → 4 (new_t2)

Tier 3: 15 − (3 + 4) → 8

`_checkBoundariesAndRecord()` only checks if new_t2 != old_t2 (which is false here) and skips promotion logic:

[LayerEdgeStaking#L876](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L876)

```solidity
if (new_t2 != old_t2)
```

It does not account for cases where T1 changes while T2 remains the same, even though the Tier 2 boundary (T1 + T2) shifts from 6 to 7.

### Expected Behavior

When stakers = 14 and a new user stakes:

New user → Promoted to Tier 3 (now 9 stakers in Tier 3).

User from Tier 2 → Promoted to Tier 1 (Tier 1 ends with: 3 stakers, Tier 2: 3 stakers).

User from Tier 3 → Promoted to Tier 2 (Tier 3 ends with: 8 stakers, Tier 2 ends with: 4 stakers).

(15 stakers in total)

At stakers = 15:

Users 1, 2, 3 -- must be -> Tier 1

Users 4, 5, 6, 7 -- must be -> Tier 2 (user 7 should be promoted from Tier 3).

But, the function incorrectly passes old_t1 + old_t2 = 6 (instead of the correct boundary 7), causing outdated tier assignments:

[LayerEdgeStaking#L897](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L897)

```solidity
    else if (!isRemoval) {
        _findAndRecordTierChange(old_t1 + old_t2, n); // ❌ Will use old boundary (6)
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

Stakers  = 5 * k (where k > 1 and odd) (e.g. stakers number equal to 15, 25, 35, ...)

### External Pre-conditions

### Impact

When S = 5k (e.g., 15, 25, 35, ..., where k > 1 and odd), tier assignments become incorrect because the Tier 2 boundary shift is ignored. This lead to missed promotions and pontentially to cascading inconsistencies during in the next staking/unstaking as demonstraded in POC:

- Harry stays in Tier 2 and Grace moves to Tier 3, even though Grace staked first.
- Tier 2 has only 3 slots, but 4 are filled (demonstrating the inconsistency)

This violates the following protocol invariants:

- Tier distribution correctness: Exactly 20% in Tier 1, 30% in Tier 2, and 50% in Tier 3 (with minimum guarantees of at least 1 user per tier when applicable)
- First-come-first-serve (FCFS) ordering: Earlier stakers should always have priority for higher tiers

### PoC

Add the following function to `LayerEdgeStaking` contract:

```solidity
function getStakerTier(address _user, uint256 _index)
        external
        view
        returns (uint256 from, uint256 to, uint256 timestamp)
    {
        TierEvent memory _tier = stakerTierHistory[_user][_index];
        from = uint256(_tier.from);
        to = uint256(_tier.to);
        timestamp = _tier.timestamp;
    }
```

Add the following code to `LayerEdgeStakingTest.t.sol`:

```solidity
    function _stake(address user, uint256 amount) internal {
        vm.startPrank(user);
        token.approve(address(staking), type(uint256).max);
        staking.stake(amount);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }

    function _unstake(address user, uint256 amount) internal {
        vm.prank(user);
        staking.unstake(amount);
    }

    function testPOC() public {
        address bruna = makeAddr("bruna");
        address duda = makeAddr("duda");
        address cami = makeAddr("cami");
        address jose = makeAddr("jose");
        address pedro = makeAddr("pedro");
        address jards = makeAddr("jards");

        vm.startPrank(admin);
        token.transfer(bruna, 3000e18);
        token.transfer(duda, 3000e18);
        token.transfer(cami, 3000e18);
        token.transfer(jose, 3000e18);
        token.transfer(pedro, 3000e18);
        token.transfer(jards, 3000e18);
        vm.stopPrank();

        _stake(alice, 3000e18); // stakers = 1
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1); // timestamp = 2
        _stake(bob, 3000e18); // stakers = 2
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1); // timestamp = 3
        _stake(charlie, 3000e18); // stakers = 3
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1); // timestamp = 4
        _stake(eve, 3000e18); // stakers = 4
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1); // timestamp = 5
        _stake(frank, 3000e18); // stakers = 5
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1); // timestamp = 6
        _stake(grace, 3000e18); // stakers = 6
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1); // timestamp = 7
        _stake(harry, 3000e18); // stakers = 7
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1); // timestamp = 8
        _stake(ian, 3000e18); // stakers = 8
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1); // timestamp = 9
        _stake(judy, 3000e18); // stakers = 9
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1); // timestamp = 10
        _stake(bruna, 3000e18); // stakers = 10
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1); // timestamp = 11
        _stake(duda, 3000e18); // stakers = 11
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1); // timestamp = 12
        _stake(cami, 3000e18); // stakers = 12
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1); // timestamp = 13
        _stake(jose, 3000e18); // stakers = 13
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1); // timestamp = 14
        _stake(pedro, 3000e18); // stakers = 14
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1); // timestamp = 15
        _stake(jards, 3000e18); // stakers = 15

        // Harry remains in Tier 3, even though Tier 2 has 4 slots and only two are filled
        (, uint256 to, uint256 timestamp) = staking.getStakerTier(harry, 0);
        assertEq(to, 3);
        assertEq(timestamp, 7);

        // There is no update in Harry's tier history
        vm.expectRevert();
        staking.getStakerTier(harry, 1);

        // Now let's see what happens when a new user enters and people unstake until new_t2 < old_t2 (Cited in Impact section)
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1); // timestamp = 16
        _stake(david, 3000e18); // stakers = 16
        (, to, timestamp) = staking.getStakerTier(harry, 1);
        assertEq(to, 2);
        assertEq(timestamp, 16);

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1); // timestamp = 17
        _unstake(david, 3000e18); // stakers = 15
        _unstake(jards, 3000e18); // stakers = 14
        _unstake(pedro, 3000e18); // stakers = 13, Tier 2 = 3 slots

        vm.expectRevert();
        (, to, timestamp) = staking.getStakerTier(harry, 2);

        (, to, timestamp) = staking.getStakerTier(grace, 2);
        assertEq(to, 3);
        assertEq(timestamp, 17);

        // Harry stays in Tier 2 and Grace moves to Tier 3, even though Grace staked first.
        // Tier 2 has only 3 slots, but 4 are filled (demonstrating the inconsistency)
    }

```shell

### Mitigation

Update the promotion/demotion logic to identify the actual users whose ranks are affected by changes.
