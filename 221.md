# Bypassing Compounding Restriction when Disabled

### Summary


The protocol allows compounding to be disabled via a toggle, but users can still manually achieve compounding by claiming accrued interest and restaking it. This bypass undermines the protocol's economic controls.


### Root Cause


The protocol only enforces the `compoundingEnabled` check within the `compoundInterest()` function in
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L213.
Manual workflows such as claiming interest and restaking it are not subject to the same restriction.


### Internal Pre-conditions


* The protocol has the `compoundingEnabled` flag set to `false`.
* The user has accrued interest in the staking contract.
* The `stakeNative()` function does not distinguish between newly staked funds and claimed interest.

### External Pre-conditions


* The attacker must have an active stake and sufficient interest accrued.
* The attacker has access to public functions like `calculateUnclaimedInterest()`, `claimInterestNative()`, and `stakeNative()`.


### Attack Path


1. The attacker waits until sufficient interest accrues.
2. Compounding is disabled by the protocol owner.
3. The attacker calls `claimInterestNative()` to withdraw their interest.
4. The attacker then calls `stakeNative{value: interest}` to restake the interest.

This sequence replicates the effect of compounding, even when it is disabled.


### Impact


* Undermines the protocolâ€™s ability to disable compounding.
* May lead to unintended inflation of staking rewards.
* Increases risk of reward over-distribution and potential economic instability for the protocol.

### PoC


```solidity
function test_noCompoundingBypass() external {
    vm.startPrank(ekene);
    vm.deal(ekene, 100_000 ether);
    staking.stakeNative{ value: 5_000 ether }();
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 365 days);
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(owner);
    staking.setCompoundingStatus(false);
    eth.deposit{ value: 100_000 ether }();
    eth.approve(address(staking), 10_000 ether);
    staking.depositRewards(5_000 ether);
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(ekene);
    vm.expectRevert("Compounding is disabled");
    staking.compoundInterest();

    uint256 interest = staking.calculateUnclaimedInterest(ekene);
    staking.claimInterestNative();
    staking.stakeNative{ value: interest }();
    vm.stopPrank();

    (uint256 balance,,,) = staking.getUserInfo(ekene);
    assertEq(balance, 5_000 ether + interest);
}
```


### Mitigation

Implement additional checks in the `stakeNative()` and `stake()` function to detect whether the stake is a new stake or a topup and:
* If `compoundingEnabled == false` and the user attempts to stake we should revert with error compounding not allowed.

Alternatively, restructure the reward claiming logic so that interest cannot be claimed independently when compounding is disabled.
