# Potential Reward Insolvency with No Failsafe

### Summary

The contract relies on having sufficient rewards in the `rewardsReserve` to pay out interest to users, but lacks a failsafe mechanism for handling situations when the reserve becomes insufficient to cover all pending rewards.

### Root Cause

When users claim interest or compound their rewards, the contract checks if there are enough rewards in the reserve:
```solidity
require(rewardsReserve >= claimable, "Insufficient rewards in contract");
```
However, there is no mechanism to handle a scenario where accumulated interest across all users exceeds the available `rewardsReserve`. This could lead to a "bank run" situation where users who claim first receive their rewards while later users cannot claim at all.

[Reference](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L788).

### Internal Pre-conditions

Insufficient amount of `rewardsReserve` to pay all claims.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. The contract allows users to earn interest based on their tier and staked amount
2. Interest accrues continuously for all users based on their APY rates
3. The `rewardsReserve` tracks available rewards for distribution
4. When a user claims or compounds, the contract checks if `rewardsReserve >= claimable`
5. If multiple users have accrued interest and `sum(all_user_interest) > rewardsReserve`, only the first users to claim will receive their rewards

### Impact

**Impact: High** - Users may be unable to claim legitimately earned interest. 
**Likelihood: Medium** - Depends on admin diligence in maintaining sufficient reward reserves.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a proportional distribution system for scenarios where the reserve is insufficient:
```solidity
function _claimInterest(address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
    _updateInterest(userAddr);

    UserInfo storage user = users[userAddr];
    uint256 claimable = user.interestEarned;

    require(claimable > 0, "Nothing to claim");

    // Calculate the actual amount to transfer based on available reserves
    uint256 amountToTransfer = rewardsReserve >= claimable ? claimable : rewardsReserve;
    
    // Update user state
    user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;
    user.interestEarned = claimable - amountToTransfer;  // Keep track of unclaimed amount
    user.totalClaimed += amountToTransfer;

    // Update rewards reserve
    rewardsReserve -= amountToTransfer;
    
    // Transfer tokens to user
    if (!isNative) {
        require(stakingToken.transfer(userAddr, amountToTransfer), "Token transfer failed");
    } else {
        IWETH(address(stakingToken)).withdraw(amountToTransfer);
        (bool success,) = payable(userAddr).call{value: amountToTransfer}("");
        require(success, "Claim interest native transfer failed");
    }

    emit RewardClaimed(userAddr, amountToTransfer);
    if (amountToTransfer < claimable) {
        emit PartialRewardClaimed(userAddr, claimable - amountToTransfer);
    }
}
```
This modification ensures that users can claim what is available, with any remaining interest tracked for future claims when more rewards are deposited.
