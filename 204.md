# Reentrancy Vulnerability in completeUnstakeNative and claimInterestNative

### Summary

The functions completeUnstakeNative and claimInterestNative perform external call operations to send native ETH before completing critical internal state updates. This opens the contract to reentrancy attacks, potentially allowing malicious users to manipulate balances or claim multiple withdrawals before the contract state is updated.



### Root Cause


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol?#L772
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L802 
```solidity
(bool success,) = payable(userAddr).call{value: amount}("");
```

to transfer native ETH to the user before or without sufficiently isolating the effect of reentrant calls. Despite nonReentrant being used, nested interactions via fallback proxies (e.g. ERC777 tokens, flash loan hooks, etc.) can still be abused unless all state changes are strictly finalized before any external calls.



### Internal Pre-conditions

unstakeRequests[userAddr][index] must be valid and not completed.

users[userAddr].interestEarned must be > 0 for claimInterestNative.

### External Pre-conditions

The recipient of native ETH (i.e., userAddr) is a contract with a fallback function that can reenter completeUnstakeNative, claimInterestNative, or other functions like stakeNative or depositRewards.



### Attack Path


1. Attacker deploys a contract with a malicious fallback function that triggers another interaction with the staking contract.
2. Attacker stakes tokens and creates a legitimate UnstakeRequest.
3. When calling completeUnstakeNative, the contract:
   - sets request.completed = true
   - then performs call{value: amount}
4. Malicious fallback function is triggered and re-enters to create inconsistencies (e.g., claim multiple interests, interrupt withdrawal logic, etc.).
5. Same logic applies to claimInterestNative.




### Impact

High: Unauthorized fund drains.

Can result in incorrect accounting, multiple reward claims, or depletion of the rewardsReserve.



### PoC

```solidity
contract MaliciousReceiver {
    LayerEdgeStaking staking;
    bool public attacked = false;

    constructor(address _staking) {
        staking = LayerEdgeStaking(_staking);
    }

    receive() external payable {
        if (!attacked) {
            attacked = true;
            // Re-enter staking function during the external call
            staking.claimInterestNative();
        }
    }

    function attack() external {
        // Assume the attacker has interest to claim
        staking.claimInterestNative(); 
    }
}


```

### Mitigation

1. Always update state before external calls:
-Move request.completed = true; and other state updates before call{value: ...}.
2. Use ReentrancyGuard consistently across internal functions called from external entrypoints.
3. Use Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern:
- All checks first
- All state changes next
- External calls last
4. Alternatively, use send or transfer, or consider pull-based withdrawal mechanisms (where users call to withdraw funds after the contract signals availability).
