# Unbound loop in _updateInterest

### Summary

`_updateInterest -> calculateUnclaimedInterest` loops over users `userTierHistory`, however this array can get inflated either maliciously or naturally, resulting in block OOG.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L418
```solidity
// Find the most recent tier event before fromTime
for (uint256 i = 0; i < userTierHistory.length; i++) {
    if (userTierHistory[i].timestamp <= fromTime) {
        currentTier = userTierHistory[i].to;
        relevantStartIndex = i;
    } else {
        break;
    }
}
```
`userTierHistory` (stakerTierHistory[userAddr]) is being looped in search for the most recent tier event. However as new users are staking and unstaking, it is possible for a user to switch back and forth between the different tiers, each time adding a new record.

### Attack Path

Either naturally, or a malicious actor can stake and unstake multiple times each time triggering tier change for affected user(s), adding tier events to a `stakerTierHistory`.

### Impact

In volatile times this can easily lead to thousands of array items, which will prevent the affected users any op as almost all of them depend on `_updateInterest -> calculateUnclaimedInterest`, which will also result in funds loss as it would be impossible to withdraw/unstake.
