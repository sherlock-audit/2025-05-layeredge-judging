# Mid-calculation overflow can lead to users unable to operate with the system

### Summary

Mid-calculation overflow can lead to users unable to operate with the system

### Root Cause

The interest for a period is calculated as follows:
```solidity
uint256 periodInterest = ((user.balance * apy * (periodEnd - periodStart)) / (SECONDS_IN_YEAR * PRECISION)) / 100;
```
Before the division, we can have a mid-calculation overflow, specifically in this part of the calculation:
```solidity
((user.balance * apy * (periodEnd - periodStart))
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User has staked a good amount, hasn't claimed interest in a while and is operating with a high APY

### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

1. User has staked a significant amount, he is a T1 staker and hasn't claimed interest for a significant amount of time
2. In the calculation shown in the root cause, due to the way Solidity works, there can be an overflow in the multiplication part of the calculation which will immediately revert, before the division
3. Users are unable to claim interest, unstake and so on as almost all operations claim the interest before proceeding

### Impact

Users are unable to claim interest, deposit, unstake and other operations that claim interest before proceeding

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use `mulDiv()` from a Math library
