###Title:
LayerEdgeStaking::calculateUnclaimedInterest may skip some reward periods because of how it checks timestamps.

Description

In the LayerEdgeStaking::calculateUnclaimedInterest function, there’s a line in the loop that says:

```solidity
if (last >= nextTimestamp) continue;
```
This line is meant to skip any reward time the user has already claimed. But in some cases, it can skip too much — even a reward period the user hasn’t claimed yet — especially if the tier records happen close together or inside the same block.

Impact

This could make the user lose part of their rewards. If a tier change happened recently and they call claimInterest() or compoundInterest() right after, the function might ignore that tier record because of how last and nextTimestamp are compared. This goes against the rule stated in the Q&A that says:

> “User rewards must be calculated correctly based on their tier history, time staked, and APY rates.”
Even if it only skips a few seconds, this could still cause unfair underpayment, especially for users with large stakes and high APYs.


Proof of Concepts

Let’s say:

The user has two tier changes, both happening at time t = 1000

The user’s lastClaimed is also set at t = 1000


When the loop reaches the tier record that ends at t = 1000, it checks:

if (last >= nextTimestamp)

Which becomes:

if (1000 >= 1000)

This is true, so the contract skips that tier record. But the user hasn’t really been paid for that time yet. That means the user loses that portion of their earned interest.

This might also happen if tier records were added in the same second, or the user moved between tiers fast and claimed in the same block.

Recommended mitigation

Instead of skipping based only on last >= nextTimestamp, it’s safer to first calculate the actual range and skip only when it’s empty. That means replacing:

if (last >= nextTimestamp) continue;

with:

uint256 from = last > record.timestamp ? last : record.timestamp;
uint256 to = nextTimestamp;
if (from >= to) continue;

This way, the contract only skips periods when there’s truly no unclaimed time, and it avoids ignoring reward intervals by mistake.
