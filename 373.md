# FenwickTree desynchronization vulnerability due to unbounded `nextJoinId` in `_stake()`

## Summary

The `LayerEdgeStaking` smart contract is susceptible to a desynchronization issue between its `stakerCountInTree` tracker and the state of its `FenwickTree` (`stakerTree`). This occurs when the `nextJoinId`, used for assigning IDs to new stakers, increments beyond the `stakerTree.size` (which is initialized to `MAX_USERS`). The `FenwickTree.update` function silently fails to incorporate stakers whose joinId exceeds this size. Consequently, `stakerCountInTree` becomes inflated relative to the tree's effective content, leading to incorrect rank calculations and tier assignments for users, thereby undermining the integrity of the tiered staking mechanism.

## Vulnerability Details

The `LayerEdgeStaking` contract utilizes a `FenwickTree` data structure (`stakerTree`) to manage staker rankings for a tiered reward system.

- A constant `MAX_USERS` defines the intended maximum number of stakers within this tier system.
```js
uint256 public constant MAX_USERS = 100_000_000;
```
- During contract initialization, stakerTree.size is set to MAX_USERS. This size parameter is critical for the FenwickTree library's internal algorithms, as functions like update only process elements if their index (derived from user.joinId) is less than or equal to stakerTree.size.
```js
    stakerTree.size = MAX_USERS; 
    nextJoinId = 1;
```
The vulnerability stems from the `_stake` function, which assigns `nextJoinId` to `user.joinId` and subsequently calls `stakerTree.update` without first validating if `nextJoinId` (and thus `user.joinId`) is within the bounds of `stakerTree.size`. 
[LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L700-L713](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L700-L713)
```js
function _stake(uint256 amount, address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
  ...//
  if (!user.isActive && amount >= minStakeAmount) {
    @>      user.joinId = nextJoinId++;
    @>      stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1);
            stakerAddress[user.joinId] = userAddr;
            user.isActive = true;
            stakerCountInTree++;

            uint256 rank = stakerTree.query(user.joinId);
            tier = _computeTierByRank(rank, stakerCountInTree);
            user.isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake = true;

            _recordTierChange(userAddr, tier);
            _checkBoundariesAndRecord(false);
        }
   ...//     
```
The `FenwickTree.update` function, when provided an `index > self.size`, does not revert but silently skips the update logic. 
[FenwickTree.sol#L10-L16](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/library/FenwickTree.sol#L10-L16)
```js
 function update(Tree storage self, uint256 index, int256 delta) internal {

        require(index > 0, "Index must be > 0"); 
        while (index <= self.size) {
            self.data[index] = uint256(int256(self.data[index]) + delta);
            index += lsb(index); 
        }
    }  
```
This results in a discrepancy: `LayerEdgeStaking` believes the `staker` is added to the tree (by incrementing `stakerCountInTree`), but the `FenwickTree` itself does not reflect this addition in its sum structure.

__Root Cause:__ The `_stake` function increments `nextJoinId` and uses it as `user.joinId` for `stakerTree.update` without first checking if `nextJoinId` exceeds `stakerTree.size`. The `FenwickTree.update` function silently skips updates for an `index > self.size, leading to a desynchronization.

__Illustrative Scenario:__

Contract initialized with `MAX_USERS` and `stakerTree.size` are both `100,000,000`.

__1. Normal Operation (Up to `MAX_USERS`-th Staker - User_X):__
  - As users stake, `nextJoinId` increments. When the `100,000,000-th` eligible staker (User_X) joins:
    - `user.joinId` is set to 100,000,000. `nextJoinId` becomes `100,000,001`.
    - `stakerTree.update(100000000, 1)` executes correctly because `index (100,000,000) <= self.size (100,000,000)`.
    - `stakerCountInTree` becomes `100,000,000`. The system remains consistent.

__2. Bug Trigger ((`MAX_USERS` + 1)-th Staker - User_Y):__
  - The next eligible staker (User_Y) joins:
    - `user.joinId` (for User_Y) is set to `nextJoinId` (which is `100,000,001`). `nextJoinId` becomes `100,000,002`.
    - `stakerTree.update(100000001, 1)` is called.
    - Inside `FenwickTree.update()`, the condition `while (index <= self.size)` (i.e., 100,000,001 <= 100,000,000) is `false`.
    - The update logic within the Fenwick tree is skipped; `stakerTree.data` is not updated for `joinId = 100,000,001`.
  - However, in `_stake()`:
    - `stakerCountInTree` is incremented to `100,000,001` ( __`stakerCountInTree` is now greater than the number of entries the Fenwick tree can effectively manage/query based on its size__).
    - `rank = stakerTree.query(user.joinId /* 100,000,001 */)`:
      - Inside [FenwickTree.sol -> query()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/library/FenwickTree.sol#L18-L23) for User_Y: This will attempt to sum values. Since `stakerTree.data[100000001]` was never set by an `update` operation within the tree's size constraints, its contribution to the sum is 0. The returned rank will be based on sums of indices up to `stakerTree.size` but not correctly reflecting User_Y's position. It will likely be an existing rank of another user or a value not representative of a new, unique entry.
   - `tier = _computeTierByRank(rank /* incorrect rank */, stakerCountInTree /* 100,000,001 */)`:

      - User_Y is assigned a tier based on an incorrectly calculated `rank` and an inflated `totalStakers` count (relative to what the Fenwick tree effectively represents for tier determination).
      - If `rank` calculation resulted in 0 (e.g. query returns 0 if `joinId` is beyond any set data and other relevant parts of tree also sum to 0), User_Y is incorrectly assigned `Tier.Tier3` due to if (rank == 0 ...) in `_computeTierByRank`.

## Impact

__Data Inconsistency:__ `stakerCountInTree` no longer accurately reflects the number of stakers correctly represented within the Fenwick tree's operational capacity.

__Incorrect Tier Assignment:__ New stakers beyond the `MAX_USERS` joinId limit are assigned incorrect ranks and, consequently, incorrect tiers (often defaulting to Tier 3 or an arbitrary tier based on a miscalculated rank).

__Skewed Tier System:__ Tier thresholds (`tier1Count`, `tier2Count` in `getTierCountForStakerCount`) are calculated using the inflated `stakerCountInTree`, potentially affecting tier boundaries and assignments for all users over time, especially when `_checkBoundariesAndRecord` is invoked.

## Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, a require statement should be added to the `_stake` function in `LayerEdgeStaking.sol`. This check must ensure that `nextJoinId` does not exceed `stakerTree.size` before a new staker's `joinId` is assigned and before `stakerTree.update` is called.
```js
  if (!user.isActive && amount >= minStakeAmount) {
            // MITIGATION: Add this check
            require(nextJoinId <= stakerTree.size, "FenwickTree: Max stakers limit reached");

            user.joinId = nextJoinId++;
            stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1);
            // ... rest of the logic 
        }
    // ...
```
