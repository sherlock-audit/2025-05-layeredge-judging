# Ambiguous OutOfTree user APY handling due to implicit tier3 defaulting

### Summary

The LayerEdge staking system maintains three staking tiers for `in-tree` users:

Tier1: Top 20%

Tier2: Next 30%

Tier3: Remaining 50%

Users enter the ranking tree by staking at or above minStakeAmount.
Users who later unstake below `minStakeAmount` are permanently demoted out of the tree (termed “OutOfTree”) and should no longer participate in the ranking-based staking reward system.

**Issue:**
Functions like `calculateUnclaimedInterest()` implicitly treat `OutOfTree` users as Tier3 by defaulting them to Tier.Tier3 when no tier history is present.
This creates ambiguity in APY application and reward calculations — especially since OutOfTree users are no longer ranked and may not be eligible for the same APY as `in-tree` Tier3 stakers.

This behavior is not explicitly handled or documented, creating a conflict with the system’s invariants.

### Root Cause

OutOfTree users are not formally assigned a tier but are implicitly defaulted to Tier.Tier3 in interest calculation and APY retrieval functions `LayerEdgeStaking::getTierAPYForPeriod()`

No mechanism exists to distinguish between in-tree Tier3 and OutOfTree stakers at the APY application level.

### Attack Path

- Finding 1:

Ambiguous Tier Defaulting in `calculateUnclaimedInterest()`

The [`calculateUnclaimedInterest()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L415) function defaults any user without tier history to Tier.Tier3, treating `OutOfTree` stakers as if they were leaderboard Tier3 stakers: 
```javascript
L415:   Tier currentTier = Tier.Tier3; // Default tier if no history
```
This assumption leads to the calculation of interest based on Tier3 APY via `getTierAPYForPeriod()`, even though these users are conceptually removed from the ranking system and may have different APY eligibility.

Conflict:
Violates Permanent Tier Demotion property by treating demoted users identically to active Tier3 stakers without formally handling their APY status.

- Finding 2:

Missing OutOfTree Tier Mapping in `getTierAPYForPeriod()`

The `getTierAPYForPeriod()` function retrieves APY rates based on staking tier:
```javascript
function getTierAPYForPeriod(Tier tier, uint256 fromTime, uint256 toTime) public view returns (uint256) {
  require(startTime < endTime, "Invalid time period");
@>        require(tier >= Tier.Tier1 && tier <= Tier.Tier3, "Invalid tier");

        // Get APY history for this tier
        APYPeriod[] storage apyPeriods = tierAPYHistory[tier];

        // If no history, return current rate
        if (apyPeriods.length == 0) {
            if (tier == Tier.Tier1) return tier1APY;
            else if (tier == Tier.Tier2) return tier2APY;
@>            else return tier3APY;
         ...
}
```
Since only `Tier1`, `Tier2`, and `Tier3` are valid inputs — and OutOfTree stakers lack a formal Tier enum value — calling this function for them implicitly assumes Tier3 APY applies.

Conflict:
Conflict: Creates ambiguity and hidden coupling between OutOfTree and in-tree Tier3 users.

 **Protocol Invariants Conflict:**
Permanent Tier Demotion: Users who unstake below minStakeAmount should permanently remain in Tier 3 (Out of tree/system)

Interest Calculation Accuracy: User rewards must be calculated correctly based on their tier history, time staked, and APY rates

This issue risks breaking both if OutOfTree stakers’ APY is supposed to differ — which is currently undocumented and unhandled.

### Impact

Potential overpayment or underpayment if the OutOfTree APY is meant to differ from Tier3 APY

Conflict with protocol invariants about permanent demotion of users and fairness guarantees

Hard-to-audit reward logic due to implicit, undocumented assumptions


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Explicitly assign and handle a distinct Tier.OutOfTree value for demoted users, with clearly defined APY rules separate from in-tree Tier3.
