# Attacker will manipulate tier positions through join ID exploitation

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L381

## Summary

**The missing validation of tier boundaries during balance changes will cause tier manipulation attacks for users as an attacker will exploit the `joinId` system to maintain higher tier benefits while reducing stake**

## Root Cause

**In the tier calculation system, user tiers are determined by `joinId` position, but there's no validation that prevents users from maintaining favorable tier positions after significantly reducing their stake below tier thresholds**

## Internal Pre-conditions

1.  User needs to be in Tier1 or Tier2 (early `joinId`)
2.  User needs to have staked above minimum amount initially
3.  Other users need to have joined after the attacker to fill tier slots

## External Pre-conditions

1.  Sufficient time needs to pass for tier benefits to accumulate
2.  Contract needs to have rewards available for higher tier rates

## Attack Path

1.  **Attacker stakes early to get low `joinId` (Tier1 position)**
2.  **Attacker accumulates high APY rewards from Tier1 rate (50%)**
3.  **Attacker unstakes most of their balance, keeping only minimal amount**
4.  **Attacker retains their `joinId` position and continues earning Tier1 rates**
5.  **Meanwhile, later stakers with larger balances are stuck in lower tiers**

## Impact

**The tier system suffers complete breakdown as attackers game the join order. Later users with larger stakes earn lower APY than early users with minimal stakes, causing unfair reward distribution.**
