# Uninitialized timestamp will undercount interest for new stakers

### Summary

The uninitialized lastTimeTierChanged timestamp will cause interest calculation inaccuracies for new stakers as the protocol fails to account for their full staking duration

### Root Cause

In `LayerEdgeStaking.sol` the `UserInfo.lastTimeTierChanged` is only set during tier changes (`_recordTierChange()` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L817-L839), creating a gap between staking time and first tier change where interest calculations use an undefined timestamp (effectively 0).

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User must be a new staker (`isActive == false`)
2. User must make their first deposit
3. User must not immediately qualify for a tier change
4. Time must pass between staking and first tier change

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. **Alice stakes 5000 tokens at block time T0**
   - `lastTimeTierChanged` remains uninitialized (0)
2. **Protocol updates APY rates at T1 (1 week later)**
   - Alice's tier potentially changes
   - `lastTimeTierChanged` gets set to T1
3. **Alice claims interest at T2**
   - Calculation uses T1 as start time instead of T0
   - Loses 1 week of interest accrual

### Impact

New stakers suffer an approximate loss of:
- Up to 100% of interest for periods before first tier change
- Exact loss proportional to time between staking and first tier change
- Particularly impacts users who stake just before APY updates

### PoC

1. Protocol launches with:
   - Tier1 APY = 50%
   - minStakeAmount = 3000 tokens
2. At T0 (Day 0):
   - Alice stakes 5000 tokens (qualifies for Tier 1)
   - `lastTimeTierChanged` remains 0
3. At T1 (Day 7):
   - Admin updates Tier1 APY to 40%
   - Alice's `lastTimeTierChanged` set to T1
4. At T2 (Day 14):
   - Alice claims interest
   - Calculation only uses (T2-T1) period (7 days)
   - Misses (T1-T0) period (7 days) of 50% APY

### Mitigation

Initialize timestamp during first stake:

```solidity
function _stake(uint256 amount, address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
    // ... existing code ...
    
    if (!user.isActive) {
        user.lastTimeTierChanged = block.timestamp;
        // ... rest of initialization ...
    }
    
    // ... rest of function ...
}
```
