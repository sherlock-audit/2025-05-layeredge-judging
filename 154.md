# `MinStakeAmount` Increase Can Cause FCFS Ordering Violation

### Summary

When the owner increases the `minStakeAmount`, users who partially unstake and fall below the new minimum are permanently removed from the Fenwick Tree ranking system. This happens even if those users staked earlier than others who remain in the tree and have a lower stake amount.

### Root Cause

The protocol permanently removes users from the Fenwick Tree ranking whenever their stake falls below the current `minStakeAmount`, without considering the relative staking order or stake amounts compared to other users. When the `minStakeAmount` is increased, previously higher-ranked users who partially unstake below the new threshold lose their ranking, while later stakers with lower stakes remain, causing violations of the intended First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) ordering.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The `minStakeAmount` has been increased by the owner.

Some users partially unstake, causing their stake to fall below the new `minStakeAmount`.

These users are permanently removed from the Fenwick Tree ranking.

Other users who staked after these removed users remain in the Fenwick Tree, even if their stakes are also below the new `minStakeAmount`.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

When the `minStakeAmount` is increased, users who staked earlier but fall below the new threshold lose their ranking and tier status, while later stakers with lower stakes remain in the system. This results in unfair tier assignments and violates the intended priority of earlier stakers, undermining the First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) fairness model.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To preserve fairness, the system could either record each userâ€™s `minStakeAmount` at the time of their first stake and use that as their personal threshold, or apply the new `minStakeAmount` globally by re-evaluating all users and demoting those who no longer meet the updated requirement, not just those who unstake.
