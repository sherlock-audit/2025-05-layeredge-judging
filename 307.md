# Compounding interest always uses the total interest amount accumulated

### Summary

Compounding interest always uses the total interest amount accumulated

### Root Cause

When users accumulate rewards from interest on their stakes, they have the option to [compound it](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L213-L241):

```solidity
    function compoundInterest() external whenCompoundingEnabled nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        _updateInterest(msg.sender);

        UserInfo storage user = users[msg.sender];
        uint256 claimable = user.interestEarned;

        require(claimable > 0, "Nothing to compound");

        // Check if we have enough rewards in the contract
        require(rewardsReserve >= claimable, "Insufficient rewards in contract");

        // Update rewards reserve
        rewardsReserve -= claimable;

        // Add earned interest to staked balance
        user.balance += claimable;
        totalStaked += claimable;

        // Reset interest tracking
        user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;
        user.interestEarned = 0;
        user.totalClaimed += claimable;

        // Determine user's tier for event (might have changed due to increased balance)
        Tier tier = getCurrentTier(msg.sender);

        emit RewardClaimed(msg.sender, claimable);
        emit Staked(msg.sender, claimable, tier);
    }
```

The issue here is that they have no freedom over the amount of their generated interest they would like to compound. The bigger the staker and their interest, the harder it will be to compound since it always tries to use the full interest generated. For example, reward deposits can be made by both admins and regular users as they are permissionless.

If a user deposits some rewards which do not cover the whale's interest accumulated, he does not have the ability to compound at least a portion of his interest.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

1. Rewards deposited
1. Whale interest generated > deposited rewards 

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Whales will have a much harder time compounding their interest compared to smaller users

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Allow partial compounding otherwise users with large interest are at a disadvantage
