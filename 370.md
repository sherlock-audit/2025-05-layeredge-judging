# Tier Manipulation Exploit via Strategic Unstaking

### Summary

The current version of the first come, first serve staking system implements boundries at 20% for Tier 1 and 30% for Tier 2. This means that there's an additional spot available in Tier 1 every 5 stakers and an additional spot in Tier 2 for every ~3.3 stakers. At multiples of 10, an additional spot opens for both tier 1 and tier 2. An attacker can use this behavior to their advantage to reduce staking rewards to others in the system.

An attacker would stake their main stake. Then they would wait until that main stake reaches Tier 1. Then they would stake the minStakeAmount from different addresses right . Once their main stake reaches Tier 1, each time the total number of stakers reaches a multiple of 10, they unstake one of their address staking the minStake. This removes a Tier 1 and Tier 2 staker, leaving more rewards available for their main stake.

### Root Cause

The first come, first serve staking system recalculates tier boundaries at fixed intervals, allowing attackers to strategically stake and unstake to manipulate available reward allocations.

### Attack Path

Attacker stakes their main position and waits until it reaches Tier 1.
Attacker stakes the minimum stake amount using multiple additional addresses.
When total staker count hits multiples of 10 (adding tier spots), attacker strategically unstakes one minimal stake.
This reduces occupied Tier 1 and Tier 2 slots, freeing more rewards for the attacker's main stake.
Repeat steps 3â€“4 to continually drain higher-tier rewards from other stakers.

### Impact

An attacker can significantly reduce rewards for legitimate stakers by continuously occupying and then vacating critical staking positions.
