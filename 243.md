# Invalid address(0) Can Be Assigned a Tier

### Summary

The contract does not validate that user addresses are non-zero (address(0)) in critical functions. This allows unintended tier assignment, reward accumulation, or stake tracking for the zero address, which could lead to logic flaws, misaccounting, or even potential exploits in reward distribution.



### Root Cause

Missing require(user != address(0), "Invalid address") checks in core functions handling staking, tier changes, and interest calculations allows operations to proceed with the zero address.

### Internal Pre-conditions

No internal validation is present to reject address(0) input.

The users, stakerTierHistory, and other mappings will accept address(0) as a valid key.

### External Pre-conditions

An external actor must call public functions such as stake, claimInterest, or getCurrentTier with address(0) as a parameter.

Depending on frontend implementation, the attacker may directly interact with the contract (e.g., via Etherscan or scripts) to bypass UI validation.



### Attack Path

An attacker (or a buggy script/frontend) sends a transaction calling stake(1000) or getCurrentTier(address(0)).

The contract accepts address(0) and proceeds to process it as a valid user.

This address is assigned a tier and possibly reward data.

These operations may corrupt internal accounting (e.g., totalStaked, stakerCountInTree), or the attacker may abuse the result in other logic (e.g., tier-based decisions).



### Impact

Logic corruption: inaccurate staking statistics and tier boundaries.

Potential future attack vectors where rewards, staking status, or withdrawals are determined by incorrect assumptions.

Waste of contract storage and event logs.

Harder auditing and debugging due to the presence of address(0) in tier history.



### PoC

```solidity
// Assume public function allows external input without frontend guardrails
contract.attack() {
    layerEdgeStaking.getCurrentTier(address(0)); 
    // or stake() if it allows passing address(0)
}
```
On-chain, the following would succeed and emit a TierChanged or Staked event for address(0) if no guards are present.



### Mitigation

```solidity
require(userAddr != address(0), "Invalid address");
```

Functions that must be updated:

_stake

_unstake

_claimInterest

_updateInterest

_recordTierChange

getCurrentTier

All public getters that accept userAddr

Additionally, consider adding input validation in any external interfaces (frontend, scripts) to prevent such misuse at the application layer.
