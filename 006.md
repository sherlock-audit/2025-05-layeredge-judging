# Denial of Service via Unbounded Tier Recalculation Loop

### Summary

The contract’s _checkBoundariesAndRecord function includes loops that iterate over a range of staker ranks when tier boundaries are re-evaluated (e.g., when a user’s staking balance crosses the minimum stake amount or causes a shift in tier sizes). Because stakerCountInTree can be very large (up to 100 million), these loops can become unbounded and cause transactions to run out of gas. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS): users may be unable to complete staking or unstaking actions if they trigger boundary changes that affect a large swath of ranks.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L827

When a user stakes/unstakes and transitions in or out of the Fenwick tree, the contract attempts to recalculate and update the tiers of all stakers whose positions fall between the old boundary and the new boundary.

For each impacted staker rank in that range, it calls stakerTree.findByCumulativeFrequency(rank) to find the user at that rank and _recordTierChange for them.

These loops (in _checkBoundariesAndRecord) can iterate over a large number of stakers, potentially in the millions, causing the transaction to exceed block gas limits and revert.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The contract has a large number of active stakers (stakerCountInTree) near or above the theoretical maximum (100 million).

The Fenwick tree (stakerTree) has been updated for all these stakers.

Tier boundaries (for Tier1 and Tier2) rely on a percentage-based split (20% for Tier1, 30% for Tier2).

### External Pre-conditions

An attacker or a large user stakes or unstakes enough tokens to move from under the minimum to above the minimum (or vice versa), causing them to enter or exit the Fenwick tree.

This single stake/unstake triggers _checkBoundariesAndRecord, which may need to recalculate and reassign many stakers’ tiers if the boundary changes significantly.

### Attack Path

Suppose there are tens of millions of stakers.

The attacker stakes or unstakes enough to push themselves from Tier3 into Tier1/Tier2 (or out of Tier1/Tier2 into Tier3), causing stakerTree.update and changing the effective boundary.

_checkBoundariesAndRecord calculates the difference between old boundaries and new boundaries. If, for instance, old_t1 was 20,000,000 and new_t1 becomes 20,000,500, it tries to loop from rank 20,000,001 to 20,000,500. This loop alone might be large enough to cause the transaction to run out of gas.

As a result, the transaction reverts, creating a situation where no one can successfully update stakes without hitting this loop, effectively blocking normal operations (DoS).

### Impact

DoS (Denial of Service): The contract can become unworkable for large boundary changes, preventing users from staking, unstaking, or claiming rewards once the staker population is large.

Freezing Contract Logic: Any user operation that triggers boundary recalculation may fail, halting contract functionality for everyone.
