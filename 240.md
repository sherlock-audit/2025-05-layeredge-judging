# Users may find impossible to update their unclaimed interest

### Summary

When user is about to do any operation (stake, unstake or claim), `calculateUnclaimedInterest()` is used to update user's pending interest, which depends on user's staked balance, Tiers to which he has belonged since last update time and APYs for those Tiers in corresponding periods.

However, under some given circumnstances it could happen that `calculateUnclaimedInterest()` reverts.

### Root Cause

The mentioned function uses two loops: one that looks for all the `userTierHistory` periods until it finds the first relevant one the other to calculate the interest during each period from the first relevant one until the current timestamp.

This means if any of these loops becomes too large, the function will revert due to an out-of-gas error. For this to happen two circumstances must occur:
1. User stakes a given amount of tokens and does no more operations (so that unclaimed interest is never updated) for a long time.
2. User experiences a lot of changes in his Tier, so that `stakerTierHistory` becomes very large for him.

These two conditions together will make that calling `calculateUnclaimedInterest()` loops for a lot of Tier events (potentially infinite of them) and making the function revert when max limit gas per block is reached.

### Attack Path

1. Alice makes a stake for the first time that puts her in Tier1.
2. For a long time, Alice does not stake, unstake or claim tokens in the protocol.
3. Alice suffers a lot of Tier changes over time (from Tier1 to Tier2) and viceversa, due to the large amount of users staking/unstaking.
4. After that long time, Alice wants to unstake his balance and take her unclaimed rewards, but this is impossible because any of these actions call `_updateInterest()`, which uses `calculateUnclaimedInterest()` to get the new total interest. The huge amount of loops that this function will trigger exceeds the block's max gas limit.

### Impact

Alice is not able to stake, unstake or claim interest, this happens because any of this actions use calculateUnclaimedInterest(), which reverts because of the mentioned OOG issue. As a result, Alice has his staked tokens frozen into the contract, as well as tokens that she should receive as interest.

The likelihood of the issue is low, because a two specific circumnstances must happen; but the severity would be so high that it deserves a medium severity at least.

### PoC

This PoC shows how a user's Tier could change over time without them making any action and how the function requires more gas as more tiers are looped by `calculateUnclaimedInterest()` function. Also note that calling this test like this is 4887237 gas units, while calculating unclaimed interest after first warp instead of after last warp would be 4866761 gas.

        console2.log("Alice's initial rank is ", uint256(tierFirst));
        console2.log("Alice's rank after everyone staked is ", uint256(tierSecond));
        console2.log("Alice's final rank is ", uint256(tierFinal));
        console2.log("Alice's unclaimed interest is", aliceInterest);
    }
```

### Mitigation

It is not 100% clear what the solution should be for this issue. A reasonable solution that mixes efficiency and security would be to check the length of `stakerTierHistory` array, evaluate whether this length and the number of TierEvents to be checked for the period of non-claimed interest  is safe and, if it was not safe, limit the amount of Tier and their associated interest to be taken into account by the function to calculate the new interest.

This could end up with user receiving less rewards than they should, but at least will prevent user from having both his staked tokens and unclaimed interests permanently frozen.
