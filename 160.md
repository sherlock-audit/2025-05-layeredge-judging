# Permanent Tier Penalty Due to Minimum Stake Race Condition

### Summary

Users who stake exactly the minimum amount can be permanently relegated to the lowest tier (Tier 3) if the contract owner changes the minimum stake amount in a transaction that gets processed before the user's staking transaction, despite the user meeting requirements at the time of transaction submission.

### Root Cause

The root cause is in the `_stake` function's conditional logic that permanently marks users as "out of tree" when their first stake is below the minimum amount, combined with the ability for the contract owner to change the minimum stake threshold at any time, without notice or delay.

```solidity
//Staking for first time and amount is less than minStakeAmount, user will be in tier 3 permanently and out of the tree
        if (!user.isActive && amount < minStakeAmount) {
            stakerCountOutOfTree++;
            user.isActive = true;
            user.outOfTree = true;
            _recordTierChange(userAddr, tier);
        }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

- A user submits a transaction to stake an amount equal to the current minimum
- The contract owner submits a transaction to increase the minimum stake amount
- The owner's transaction gets included before the user's transaction

### Attack Path

1. Initial state: `minStakeAmount` = 3000 tokens
2. User sends transaction to stake exactly 3000 tokens
3. Owner sends transaction to increase `minStakeAmount` to 4000 tokens
4. Owner's transaction is processed first
5. User's transaction is processed with new `minStakeAmount` of 4000
6. Since `3000 < 4000`, the user's status is set to `outOfTree = true`
7. The user is permanently locked into Tier 3 with no way to re-enter the tree

### Impact

- Users lose significant potential rewards
- Users receive only 20% APY (Tier 3) instead of potentially 50% APY (Tier 1)
- This is permanent for the life of the staking position
- Damages user trust and protocol reputation
- Could lead to mass withdrawals if multiple users are affected

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Several options to address this vulnerability:
1. Add a timelock for parameter changes
2. Remove the permanent penalty
3. Add a grace period for users to adjust to parameter changes
