# Multiple vulnerabilities will cause risks for users and developers

**1. Issue: require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= wad); lacks an error message**
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/WETH9.sol#L27
Severity: Low  
Fix: Add message for better debugging: require(..., "WETH9: insufficient balance");
Form Entry:
Add a title: "Missing error message causes unclear debugging for users"  
Summary: "The missing error message in require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= wad) causes unclear debugging for users as developers struggle to identify issues"  
Root Cause: "In WETH9.sol the missing error message in require for balance check"  
Severity Assessment: Low – No impact on functionality or security, but affects developer experience.

**2. Issue: withdraw() lacks fallback for failed ETH transfer**
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/WETH9.sol#L29
Severity: Medium  
Fix: Add success check in payable(msg.sender).transfer(wad);, despite .transfer() being generally safe
Form Entry:
Add a title: "Failed ETH transfer causes fund loss for users"  
Summary: "The missing success check in withdraw() causes fund loss for users as failed ETH transfers are unhandled"  
Root Cause: "In WETH9.sol the missing success check on payable(msg.sender).transfer(wad) in withdraw"  
Severity Assessment: Medium – Potential fund loss if ETH transfer fails silently.

**3. Issue: No EIP-2612 (ERC20Permit) support**
Severity: Medium  
Fix: Not critical if gasless approvals via approve() are not needed
Form Entry:
Add a title: "Missing EIP-2612 support causes user inconvenience"  
Summary: "The lack of EIP-2612 support in WETH9.sol causes user inconvenience as gasless approvals via permit are unavailable"  
Root Cause: "In WETH9.sol the absence of EIP-2612 (ERC20Permit) implementation"  
Severity Assessment: Medium – Impacts usability but not security.

**4. Issue: No separate mint/burn functions**
Severity: Low  
Fix: Acceptable since this token wraps native ETH, no need for mint/burn
Form Entry:
Add a title: "Missing mint/burn functions limit developer functionality"  
Summary: "The absence of mint and burn functions in WETH9.sol limits developer functionality as token supply cannot be directly managed"  
Root Cause: "In WETH9.sol the missing implementation of separate mint and burn functions"  
Severity Assessment: Low – No impact on core functionality; deposit/withdraw handle this implicitly.
