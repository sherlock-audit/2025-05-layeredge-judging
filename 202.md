# Users can avoid expected demotion due to minStakeAmount increase and continue receiving higher APY than they should

### Summary

The LayerEdgeStaking contract allows users with balances below a newly increased minStakeAmount to retain higher tiers until their next action (e.g., unstake), causing inconsistent tier assignments. This occurs because setMinStakeAmount does not proactively demote users. 

### Root Cause

Lazy evaluation of user tier, allowing outdated tiers to persist until user interaction.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- minStakeAmount is increased via setMinStakeAmount.
- Users in the FenwickTree have balance >= old minStakeAmount but < new minStakeAmount

### External Pre-conditions

- Affected users do not interact with the contract immediately, allowing outdated tiers to persist.

### Attack Path

1. minStakeAmount = 3000 * 1e18; User A stakes 3000 * 1e18, assigned to Tier 1 or 2.
2. Owner sets minStakeAmount = 5000 * 1e18.
3. User A remains in Tier 1/2, earning higher APY, despite balance < minStakeAmount.
4. User A unstakes later, triggering demotion to Tier 3 but with greater rewards than they should've earned

### Impact

Users gain undue APY benefits, earning greater rewards than intended.

### PoC

```solidity
function test_LayerEdgeStaking_Unstake_FullUnstake() public {
        // Alice stakes
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE);
        staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
        vm.stopPrank();

         staking.getCurrentTier(alice); // 1
        
        // admin increases minStakeAmount
        vm.prank(admin);
        staking.setMinStakeAmount(MIN_STAKE*2);
      
        // Advance time
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 7 days + 1);

        staking.getCurrentTier(alice); // Still in tier 1 despite insufficient stake
        (, LayerEdgeStaking.Tier tier, uint256 apy,) = staking.getUserInfo(alice); // APY == 50

```

### Mitigation

One solution is to snapshot user balances and minStakeAmount changes then perform yield calculations based on the snapshotted values at different times.
