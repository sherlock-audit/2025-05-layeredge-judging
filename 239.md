###Title:
LayerEdgeStaking::calculateUnclaimedInterest can pay too much or too small because tier time is not handled well

Description

In the calculateUnclaimedInterest() function, the contract uses two values — from and to — to know how long the user stayed in a tier. It writes it like this:

```solidity
uint256 from = last > record.timestamp ? last : record.timestamp;
uint256 to = nextTimestamp;
```

But if two tier records happen close or at the same time, or if they are not in the right order, this thing can go wrong. It may count the same time more than once, or skip time the user should be paid for. The contract does not check if the tier records are clean or correct before using them.

Impact

This can cause 2 bad things:

1. Too much rewards: If two tier records are at the same time, the function can pay interest for the same time two times. This means the user gets more money than they should.

2. Too small rewards: If the records are not in the right order or have a small gap, the contract may skip some time. So the user gets less than they should.

This breaks the system rule that says rewards must match tier history and time.

Proof of Concepts

Case 1 – Overpay

A user gets a Tier 2 record at time t = 1000

Another record (maybe Tier 1) is added also at t = 1000

The loop runs both

Interest is counted two times for the same second


Case 2 – Underpay

A user is in Tier 1 from time 1000 to 2000

But a Tier 3 record starts at 1999

Now the function may skip 1 second

The user gets less than they earned


Recommended mitigation

Make sure tier records do not have the same timestamp or go out of order.
Also add a line to skip wrong records like this:

```solidity
if (from >= to) continue;
```
And when updating tier history, make sure no two records are added with the same time.
