# Un-capped APY value allowed by the specification breaks the contract

### Summary

The statement in the README ­– “APY Rates: No upper limits on tier1APY, tier2APY, tier3APY” – will cause a loss of liveness or insolvency for every staker, because when an auditor (or QA script) sets an APY anywhere above ~3 × 10⁶⁴ the interest-calculation math overflows and all subsequent state-changing calls revert; even at much lower values (e.g. 10 000 % APR) the contract legitimately mints rewards faster than rewardsReserve can cover, so later users’ claims revert with “Insufficient rewards”.
Thus the range that the specification says must be safe is in fact unsafe.

### Root Cause

In LayerEdgeStaking.sol (updateTierAPY() and updateAllAPYs()) the new rate is stored without bounds-checking.
calculateUnclaimedInterest() later performs

```solidity
uint256 periodInterest =
                ((user.balance * apy * (periodEnd - periodStart)) / (SECONDS_IN_YEAR * PRECISION)) / 100;
            totalInterest += periodInterest;
```

• If apy ≳ 3e64 the multiplication overflows → every call that touches interest reverts (DoS).
• If apy is simply “very high” (≥ 10 000 % APR) the arithmetic is valid, but early claimers legitimately drain rewardsReserve, after which all other claims/compounds revert.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Tester (following the README’s “no upper limits” rule) calls updateTierAPY() or updateAllAPYs() with a. rate ≥ 3e64 → overflow path, or b. rate ≥ 10_000 * 1e18 (10 000 % APR) → reserve-drain path.
At least one user has a positive stake.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path


Overflow variant

Tester sets tier1APY to 4e64.
Any user invokes stake / claimInterest / etc.
Multiplication in calculateUnclaimedInterest wraps → revert.
From this point every function that updates interest reverts: protocol frozen.
Reserve-drain variant

Tester sets tier1APY = 10_000 * 1e18.
A user stakes a large amount, waits one block, calls claimInterest; rewards for that single block deplete rewardsReserve.
Subsequent claimInterest and compoundInterest calls by anyone revert with “Insufficient rewards in contract”.

### Impact

All stakers are unable to stake, unstake, claim or compound (liveness loss) or are unable to receive their earned rewards (economic loss) 

### PoC

PoC – overflow (Foundry)

```solidity
function test_APYOverflow_DoS() public {
    vm.prank(admin);
    staking.updateTierAPY(LayerEdgeStaking.Tier.Tier1, 4e64); // still far below uint256.max
    vm.prank(alice);
    vm.expectRevert();                       // arithmetic overflow
    staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
}

```
PoC – reserve drain (Foundry)

```solidity
function test_APYReserveDrain() public {
    vm.prank(admin);
    staking.updateTierAPY(LayerEdgeStaking.Tier.Tier1, 10_000 * 1e18); // 10 000 % APR
    vm.prank(alice);
    staking.stake(100_000 ether);
    vm.roll(block.number + 1);
    vm.prank(alice);
    staking.claimInterest();                 // empties rewardsReserve
    vm.prank(bob);
    vm.expectRevert("Insufficient rewards in contract");
    staking.claimInterest();
}

```

### Mitigation

Define an explicit upper bound.

```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_APY = 1_000 * 1e18; // 1 000 % APR
require(rate <= MAX_APY, "APY too high");

```
