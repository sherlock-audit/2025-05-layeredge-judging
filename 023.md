# Malicious users will drain the rewards reserve causing protocol insolvency

### Summary

The LayerEdgeStaking contract's rewards reserve management system contains a critical vulnerability due to the absence of an automatic replenishment mechanism and unlimited APY rate setting capabilities. This design flaw will cause a complete loss of interest payments for all stakers as malicious users can coordinate to rapidly deplete the reserve through a combination of high APY settings and synchronized mass interest claims. The vulnerability stems from the fundamental economic imbalance where interest accrual can significantly exceed the available reserves, especially during periods of high user activity or when APY rates are set aggressively. Once the reserve is depleted, all subsequent interest claims will fail, effectively breaking a core protocol promise to users and potentially triggering a mass exodus from the platform.


### Root Cause

In [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L342-L356]([edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol)#L342-L356 ) the `_claimInterest()` function has no mechanism to automatically replenish the rewards reserve or adjust APY rates based on available reserves. Additionally, in [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L412-L425]([edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol)#L412-L425 ) and [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L427-L446]([edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol)#L427-L446 ), the `updateTierAPY` and `updateAllAPYs` functions allow setting arbitrarily high APY values without any upper bounds or correlation to available reserves.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to set a high APY rate (e.g., 50% or higher)
  2. The number of stakers needs to be large enough to generate significant interest claims
  3. The rewards reserve needs to be less than the total potential interest claims
  4. Multiple users must have accumulated substantial unclaimed interest

### External Pre-conditions

1. No external pre-conditions required

### Attack Path

1. Multiple users stake large amounts of tokens
  2. Interest accumulates over time at the high APY rate
  3. Users coordinate to claim interest simultaneously
  4. The rewards reserve is depleted
  5. Subsequent interest claims revert due to insufficient funds in the reserve

### Impact

The stakers suffer a complete loss of earned interest as they cannot claim their rewards. The protocol suffers reputational damage and potential user exodus. This creates a 'bank run' scenario where users rush to withdraw their principal, potentially causing cascading liquidity issues across the protocol. Early claimers receive their full interest while later claimers receive nothing, creating an unfair distribution of rewards.

### Mitigation

1. Implement a dynamic APY system that adjusts based on available rewards reserve
  2. Add an automatic replenishment mechanism for the rewards reserve
  3. Set minimum threshold for rewards reserve with warning system
  4. Implement a rate limiting mechanism for interest claims during low reserve periods
  5. Add upper bounds to APY rates to prevent economically unsustainable settings
