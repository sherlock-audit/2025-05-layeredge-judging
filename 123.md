# Users can frontrun other users to steal their tier

### Summary

The tier allocation system assigns users to tiers based on their transaction order (FCFS). Attackers can exploit Ethereum’s public mempool to frontrun legitimate staking transactions, stealing higher-tier positions by submitting their own transactions with higher gas fees.



### Root Cause

In the `LayerEdgeStaking.sol` the [`stake()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L674-L723) is not encoded leaving every `stake()` call readable to other users. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

1. A user or number of users has called the `stake()`
2. Attacker sees in the mempool and submit his transaction with higher gas fees

### Attack Path

1. Attacker watches for pending stake() transactions.
2. Attacker replicates the victim’s staking parameters (e.g., amount), submits the transaction with higher gas fees.
3. Attacker’s transaction is mined first, granting them a lower join ID and higher tier.
4. Victim’s transaction is processed later, resulting in a lower-tier assignment.

### Impact

1. Legitimate users receive reduced APY due to tier displacement.
2. Users lose confidence in the fairness of the staking system.

### PoC

Actors
Alice: Legitimate user attempting to stake.
Bob: Attacker.

Steps

1. Alice submits a stake(3000 EDGEN) transaction.
2. Bob detects Alice’s transaction in the mempool.
3. Bob sends an identical stake(3000 EDGEN) transaction with a 2x gas fee.
4. Bob’s transaction is mined in Block N; Alice’s in Block N+1.

Result:

Bob receives joinId = 101 (Tier 1).
Alice receives joinId = 102 (Tier 2).
