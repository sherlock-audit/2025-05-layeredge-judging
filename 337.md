# (High) Fenwick Tree Index Overflow Causes Permanent Tier System Corruption

### Summary

Missing bounds checking on `nextJoinId` will cause permanent tier system corruption for all stakers as the protocol will experience silent Fenwick tree update failures when user count exceeds `MAX_USERS`, creating irreversible state desynchronization between contract accounting and the underlying ranking data structure.

### Root Cause

In `LayerEdgeStaking.sol:_stake()` at line [700](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L700), there is no bounds checking on `nextJoinId` before using it in Fenwick tree operations. When `nextJoinId` exceeds `MAX_USERS` (100,000,000), the `FenwickTree.update()` function silently fails due to its loop condition `while (index <= self.size)`, but the contract state continues to be updated normally, creating permanent desynchronization.

```solidity
// In _stake() function - VULNERABLE CODE
if (!user.isActive && amount >= minStakeAmount) {
    user.joinId = nextJoinId++;           // ⚠️ No bounds checking!
    stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1);    // ⚠️ Silent failure if joinId > MAX_USERS
    stakerAddress[user.joinId] = userAddr;
    user.isActive = true;
    stakerCountInTree++;                  // ⚠️ Still increments despite tree failure!
    // ...
}
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Protocol needs to accumulate exactly 100,000,000 active stakers to set `nextJoinId` to `MAX_USERS`
2. One additional user needs to stake at least `minStakeAmount` to trigger `nextJoinId = MAX_USERS + 1`

### External Pre-conditions

None required.

### Attack Path

This is a system failure rather than an attack:

1. Protocol operates normally until reaching 100,000,000 stakers (`nextJoinId = MAX_USERS`)
2. The 100,000,001st user calls `stake()` with amount ≥ `minStakeAmount`
3. Contract assigns `user.joinId = MAX_USERS + 1` and increments `nextJoinId`
4. `stakerTree.update(MAX_USERS + 1, 1)` silently fails (no tree update occurs)
5. Contract state updates normally (user marked active, `stakerCountInTree` incremented)
6. User gets `rank = 0` from `stakerTree.query()`, assigned to Tier 3 despite being 2nd globally
7. All subsequent users experience the same corruption
8. Tier boundary calculations become permanently incorrect due to wrong `stakerCountInTree`

### Impact

The tier system suffers complete and permanent corruption. All users with `joinId > MAX_USERS` are incorrectly assigned to Tier 3 regardless of their actual ranking, receiving 20% APY instead of potentially 50% (Tier 1) or 35% (Tier 2). The protocol cannot calculate correct tier boundaries, leading to wrong reward distributions for all users. The system becomes permanently broken with no recovery mechanism.

### PoC

```solidity
// Add the following function to `LayerEdgeStakingTest.t.sol`
    function test_FenwickTreeOverflow_StateDesynchronization() public {
        uint256 maxUsers = staking.MAX_USERS();

        // Set nextJoinId to MAX_USERS + 1 so the FIRST staker gets an invalid joinId
        vm.store(address(staking), bytes32(uint256(13)), bytes32(maxUsers + 1));

        assertEq(
            staking.nextJoinId(),
            maxUsers + 1,
            "nextJoinId should be MAX_USERS + 1"
        );

        // Alice stakes and should get invalid joinId = MAX_USERS + 1
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE);
        staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Extract Alice's state
        (
            ,
            ,
            ,
            ,
            uint256 aliceJoinId,
            ,
            bool aliceOutOfTree,
            bool aliceIsActive,

        ) = staking.users(alice);

        // 1. Alice gets invalid joinId > MAX_USERS
        assertEq(
            aliceJoinId,
            maxUsers + 1,
            "Alice should have invalid joinId > MAX_USERS"
        );

        // 2. Contract state shows Alice as active and in tree
        assertFalse(
            aliceOutOfTree,
            "Contract incorrectly thinks Alice is in tree"
        );
        assertTrue(aliceIsActive, "Contract thinks Alice is active");
        assertEq(
            staking.stakerCountInTree(),
            1,
            "Contract thinks there is 1 user in tree"
        );

        // Alice should be Tier 1 as first staker, but gets Tier 3 due to Fenwick failure
        LayerEdgeStaking.Tier aliceTier = staking.getCurrentTier(alice);
        assertEq(
            uint256(aliceTier),
            uint256(LayerEdgeStaking.Tier.Tier3),
            "Alice incorrectly assigned Tier 3 despite being first staker"
        );

        // Adding second user(Bob) to show system corruption spreading
        vm.startPrank(bob);
        token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE);
        staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Bob also gets corrupted
        (, , , , uint256 bobJoinId, , , , ) = staking.users(bob);
        assertEq(bobJoinId, maxUsers + 2, "Bob has invalid joinId too");
        assertEq(
            uint256(staking.getCurrentTier(bob)),
            uint256(LayerEdgeStaking.Tier.Tier3),
            "Bob also incorrectly assigned Tier 3"
        );

        assertEq(staking.stakerCountInTree(), 2, "Contract counts 2 users");
        // But both users get Tier 3 due to Fenwick tree corruption
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Add bounds checking in the `_stake()` function to prevent `nextJoinId` from exceeding `MAX_USERS`:
```solidity
function _stake(uint256 amount, address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
    require(amount > 0, "Cannot stake zero amount");
    
    UserInfo storage user = users[userAddr];
    _updateInterest(userAddr);
    
    // ... token transfer logic ...
    
    if (!user.isActive && amount >= minStakeAmount) {
        // ADD BOUNDS CHECK HERE
        require(nextJoinId <= MAX_USERS, "Maximum users exceeded");
        
        user.joinId = nextJoinId++;
        stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1);
        stakerAddress[user.joinId] = userAddr;
        user.isActive = true;
        stakerCountInTree++;
        
        // ... rest of function
    }
    // ...
}
```
