# Race condition for claiming rewards

### Summary

Claiming rewards creates a race condition

### Root Cause

Users accrue interest and when rewards are deposited into the contract they are able to claim. If there are currently no rewards in the contract then users have to wait until they are deposited.

The issue is that unlike other staking protocols where user rewards accumulate based on the total rewards deposited and the reward rate computed from a user's stake, here interest is accumulated based on APY's set by the protocol. So by staking, users will continually accumulate interest (which they can also compound). This becomes an issue when rewards are deposited as an absolute amount that anyone can claim from and becomes a race condition for who can claim first.

For example, Alice, Bob and Charlie all have the same stake in the protocol and accumulate the same interest. Depositing rewards is permisionless and anyone can do it. At some point in time a user makes the call to `depositRewards()` and increase the `rewardsReserve`:

```solidity
    function depositRewards(uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        require(amount > 0, "Cannot deposit zero amount");

        // Update rewards reserve
        rewardsReserve += amount;

        // Transfer tokens from sender to contract
        require(stakingToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount), "Token transfer failed");
    }
```

Although all 3 users have staked at the same time and accumulated the same rewards, it becomes a race condition of who's transaction can pass to [claim](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L779-L807) them first since they will take the whole rewards amount:

```solidity
    function _claimInterest(address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
        _updateInterest(userAddr);

        UserInfo storage user = users[userAddr];
        uint256 claimable = user.interestEarned;

        require(claimable > 0, "Nothing to claim");

        // Check if we have enough rewards in the contract
        require(rewardsReserve >= claimable, "Insufficient rewards in contract");

        user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;
        user.interestEarned = 0;
        user.totalClaimed += claimable;

        // Update rewards reserve
        rewardsReserve -= claimable;

        // Transfer tokens to user
        if (!isNative) {
            require(stakingToken.transfer(userAddr, claimable), "Token transfer failed");
        } else {
            IWETH(address(stakingToken)).withdraw(claimable);
            (bool success,) = payable(userAddr).call{value: claimable}("");
            require(success, "Claim interest native transfer failed");
        }

        emit RewardClaimed(userAddr, claimable);
    }
```

This creates a situation where whale stakers who accumulate much more rewards than other users will claim as many rewards as they can when they are deposited, leaving other stakers not being able to claim their rewards. Even in the situation where the 3 users staked the same amount at the same time, if an arbitrary user supplies some rewards then the first to claim will take them all and they will not be distributed proportionally.

Rewards are not distributed proportionally creating a race condition for claiming

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Distribute rewards proportionally instead
