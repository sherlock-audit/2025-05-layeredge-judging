# Malicious Admin Can Arbitrarily Manipulate APY Rates, Denying Users Expected Rewards

### Summary

Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?


### Root Cause

The onlyOwner modifier on updateTierAPY and updateAllAPYs grants the admin unrestricted and immediate power to change APY rates to any value, including zero.
Lack of protective mechanisms like timelocks, governance controls, or rate change thresholds for APY modifications.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The LayerEdgeStaking contract is deployed and initialized.
2. The contract owner (admin) has control over the onlyOwner functions.
3. Users have staked tokens in the contract, expecting to earn rewards based on the advertised or current APY rates.
4. The private keys from the admin are compromised

### External Pre-conditions

1. Admin keys are leaked

### Attack Path

0. Compromise the admin keys
1. Attract Stakers: The admin might initially set attractive APY rates (e.g., the default 50%/35%/20% or even higher) to encourage users to stake significant amounts.
2. Wait for Stakes: The admin waits for a substantial amount of tokens to be staked by users.
3. Manipulate APYs: The admin calls updateAllAPYs(0, 0, 0) or updateTierAPY(tier, 0) for each tier, setting all APY rates to zero.
 
```Solidity
// Admin action:
// vm.prank(admin);
// staking.updateAllAPYs(0, 0, 0);
```
4. Observe Impact: Users who staked expecting rewards will now accrue no further interest.



### Impact

- High Financial Impact for Users: Users lose out on expected future earnings.
- Reputational Damage: Such actions would severely damage trust in the platform and the admin.
- User Exodus: Users are likely to withdraw their funds if possible, leading to a collapse of the staking pool.
- Violation of User Expectation: Users stake with the expectation of earning yield; reducing this to zero arbitrarily breaks this implicit contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Timelocks: Introduce a timelock mechanism for significant APY changes (e.g., reductions below a certain threshold or setting to zero). This would require the admin to announce the change, which then only takes effect after a predefined delay (e.g., 24-72 hours), giving users time to react.

Example for replacing the entry https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L272

```Solidity
[..]
    // For APY change timelock (conceptual)
    struct PendingAPYChange {
        uint256 newTier1APY;
        uint256 newTier2APY;
        uint256 newTier3APY;
        uint256 effectiveTime;
    }
    PendingAPYChange public pendingAPYUpdate;
    uint256 public constant APY_UPDATE_DELAY = 2 days; // Example delay
[..]

function proposeAllAPYs(uint256 _tier1APY, uint256 _tier2APY, uint256 _tier3APY) external onlyOwner {
        // Basic validation: ensure rates are not excessively high if desired
        // require(_tier1APY < SOME_MAX_APY && _tier2APY < SOME_MAX_APY && _tier3APY < SOME_MAX_APY, "APY too high");

        pendingAPYUpdate = PendingAPYChange({
            newTier1APY: _tier1APY,
            newTier2APY: _tier2APY,
            newTier3APY: _tier3APY,
            effectiveTime: block.timestamp + APY_UPDATE_DELAY
        });
        // Emit an event for proposed change
    }

    function enactAllAPYs() external onlyOwner {
        require(pendingAPYUpdate.effectiveTime > 0, "No pending APY update");
        require(block.timestamp >= pendingAPYUpdate.effectiveTime, "APY update delay not passed");

        uint256 _tier1APY = pendingAPYUpdate.newTier1APY;
        uint256 _tier2APY = pendingAPYUpdate.newTier2APY;
        uint256 _tier3APY = pendingAPYUpdate.newTier3APY;

        // Update all rates
        tier1APY = _tier1APY;
        tier2APY = _tier2APY;
        emit APYUpdated(Tier.Tier1, _tier1APY, currentTime);
        emit APYUpdated(Tier.Tier2, _tier2APY, currentTime);
        emit APYUpdated(Tier.Tier3, _tier3APY, currentTime);

        // Clear pending update
        delete pendingAPYUpdate;
    }


```


2. Rate Change Constraints: Implement logic within the APY update functions to limit how drastically APYs can be changed in a single transaction or over a short period. For example, prevent APY from being reduced by more than X% per week or prevent setting it below a very small, non-zero "floor" APY unless a more stringent process is followed.
 
3. Event Emission Clarity: Ensure APYUpdated events are clear and easily monitorable off-chain so users can be alerted to changes. (The current event emission is good).
 
4. Multi-Signature Ownership: If full decentralization via DAO is not feasible, transferring ownership to a multi-signature wallet controlled by multiple trusted parties can reduce the risk of a single malicious admin.
