# Admin Functions for APY & Minimum Stake Amount Lack Critical Input Validation, Risking Harmful Configurations

--- 

## M-01: Lack of Input Validation in Admin Functions Can Lead to Rewards Pool Depletion or Staking Functionality Breakdown

medium

---

### Related Functions

- `updateTierAPY(Tier tier, uint256 rate)`
- `updateAllAPYs(uint256 _tier1APY, uint256 _tier2APY, uint256 _tier3APY)`
- `setMinStakeAmount(uint256 amount)`

---

### Brief Description

Admin-only functions `updateTierAPY`, `updateAllAPYs`, and `setMinStakeAmount` lack sufficient input validation for critical protocol parameters. This allows an admin (potentially through error or malicious intent if the key is compromised and no timelock exists for these actions) to set values to extremes or inconsistencies.

> **Current Issue:**
> - **APY Settings:** APY can be set to excessively high values (e.g., 500,000%), risking rapid rewards pool depletion, or to zero, which removes staking incentives.
> - **Minimum Stake Amount:** `minStakeAmount` can be set to extremely large values (e.g., greater than total token supply), effectively disabling staking for all users, or to zero, negating its purpose.

Such configurations can lead to a loss of funds from the rewards pool or break core staking functionality, justifying a Medium severity.

---

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The `owner` account (admin) has the authority to call the privileged functions (`updateTierAPY`, `updateAllAPYs`, `setMinStakeAmount`).
- The LayerEdgeStaking contract is deployed and operational.

### External Pre-conditions

- **For accidental misconfiguration:** N/A. The vulnerability is the lack of safeguards against admin error.
- **For malicious exploitation (if owner key is compromised):** An attacker must have gained unauthorized access to the owner's private key.

### Attack Path

The lack of input validation allows the admin (or an attacker with the owner's key) to execute the following:

1.  **Excessive APY Setting:**
    *   Call `updateTierAPY(Tier.TierN, excessively_high_rate)` e.g., `50000000` (representing 500,000% APY if APY is in basis points x 100).
    *   Call `updateAllAPYs(excessively_high_rate_t1, ..., ...)` with similar extreme values.
2.  **Zero APY Setting:**
    *   Call `updateTierAPY(Tier.TierN, 0)`.
3.  **Impractical Minimum Stake Amount:**
    *   Call `setMinStakeAmount(extremely_high_value)` e.g., a value greater than the total token supply like `type(uint256).max`.
4.  **Nullified Minimum Stake Amount:**
    *   Call `setMinStakeAmount(0)`.

---

### Impact

- **Rewards Pool Depletion (via Extreme APY):**
  - Setting an excessively high APY (e.g., 500,000%) could rapidly drain the rewards pool if sufficient stake exists. This compromises the protocol's ability to meet future reward obligations to all stakers, constituting a loss relevant to the protocol and its users (loss of future, promised yield).
  - Setting APY to zero or an extremely low value disincentivizes staking, potentially leading to a loss of users and TVL, and undermining the protocol's utility.

- **Staking Functionality Breakdown (via Extreme `minStakeAmount`):**
  - Setting `minStakeAmount` to an impractically high value (e.g., greater than circulating supply or a multi-million dollar equivalent) effectively disables the `stake()` function for all legitimate users. This breaks a core functionality of the contract.
  - Setting `minStakeAmount` to zero removes any barrier to entry, which might be contrary to the protocol's design for preventing dust stakes or ensuring meaningful participation.

These impacts align with Sherlock's Medium severity criteria: "causes a loss of funds but requires certain external conditions or specific states... The loss must be relevant to the affected party" OR "Breaks core contract functionality..."

### Code Reference

The following functions in [src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol) are relevant to this finding:

- **`updateTierAPY(Tier tier, uint256 rate)`**
    *   **Location:** ['src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L248-L262'](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L248-L262)
    *   **Description:** This function allows the admin (`owner`) to update the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) rate for a specific tier (`Tier.Tier1`, `Tier.Tier2`, or `Tier.Tier3`). The `rate` parameter is the new APY to be set. The function lacks validation to ensure the `rate` is within reasonable bounds (e.g., not excessively high, which could quickly deplete reward funds, or zero, which would remove incentives).
    ```solidity
    function updateTierAPY(Tier tier, uint256 rate) external onlyOwner {
        require(tier >= Tier.Tier1 && tier <= Tier.Tier3, "Invalid tier");

        // Update the current rate for the tier
        if (tier == Tier.Tier1) {
            tier1APY = rate;
        } else if (tier == Tier.Tier2) {
            tier2APY = rate;
        } else {
            tier3APY = rate;
        }

        // Add to history for this specific tier
        tierAPYHistory[tier].push(APYPeriod({rate: rate, startTime: block.timestamp}));

        emit APYUpdated(tier, rate, block.timestamp);
    }
    ```

    **`updateAllAPYs(uint256 _tier1APY, uint256 _tier2APY, uint256 _tier3APY)`**
    *   **Location:** ['src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L271-L286'](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L271-L286)
    *   **Description:** This function allows the admin (`owner`) to update the APY rates for all three tiers simultaneously. Similar to `updateTierAPY`, the parameters `_tier1APY`, `_tier2APY`, and `_tier3APY` lack validation for reasonable upper or lower bounds.
    ```solidity
    function updateAllAPYs(uint256 _tier1APY, uint256 _tier2APY, uint256 _tier3APY) external onlyOwner {
        // Update all rates
        tier1APY = _tier1APY;
        tier2APY = _tier2APY;
        tier3APY = _tier3APY;

        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

        // Add to history for each tier
        tierAPYHistory[Tier.Tier1].push(APYPeriod({rate: _tier1APY, startTime: currentTime}));
        tierAPYHistory[Tier.Tier2].push(APYPeriod({rate: _tier2APY, startTime: currentTime}));
        tierAPYHistory[Tier.Tier3].push(APYPeriod({rate: _tier3APY, startTime: currentTime}));

        emit APYUpdated(Tier.Tier1, _tier1APY, currentTime);
        emit APYUpdated(Tier.Tier2, _tier2APY, currentTime);
        emit APYUpdated(Tier.Tier3, _tier3APY, currentTime); // End line might vary slightly
    }
    ```

- **`setMinStakeAmount(uint256 amount)`**
    *   **Location:** ['src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L334-L336'](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L334-L336)
    *   **Description:** This function allows the admin (`owner`) to set the minimum amount of tokens required for a user to stake. The amount parameter is not validated to ensure it's non-zero, not excessively high (which could prevent reasonable participation), or not too low (rendering it ineffective).
    ```solidity
   function setMinStakeAmount(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        minStakeAmount = amount;
    }
    ```
---

### Mitigation

The following recommendations correspond to the "Recommendations" section of a standard audit report.

#### 1. **Comprehensive Input Validation**

Implement robust input validation for all admin-configurable parameters using `require` statements to enforce sensible boundaries.

-   **APY Setting Functions (`updateTierAPY`, `updateAllAPYs`):**
    Ensure APY rates are within a predefined, reasonable range.
    *   Define `MIN_APY_RATE` and `MAX_APY_RATE` constants (or state variables configurable by an admin, with their own validation).
    *   `MIN_APY_RATE` should be non-zero (or a very low, clearly defined minimum) to maintain incentives or reflect intentional design.
    *   `MAX_APY_RATE` should be realistic (e.g., not exceeding 100-200% annually without very strong justification and economic modeling) to protect reward funds.

    Example for `updateTierAPY(Tier tier, uint256 rate)`:
    ```solidity
    // Inside updateTierAPY function, after existing require for tier:
    require(rate >= MIN_APY_RATE, "APY rate below minimum allowed");
    require(rate <= MAX_APY_RATE, "APY rate above maximum allowed");
    // ... rest of the function
    ```
    Apply similar logic for `_tier1APY`, `_tier2APY`, and `_tier3APY` within `updateAllAPYs`.

-   **`setMinStakeAmount(uint256 amount)`:**
    Ensure the minimum stake amount is non-zero and within reasonable bounds.
    *   It should likely be greater than zero.
    *   Consider defining `MAX_ALLOWED_MIN_STAKE_AMOUNT` to prevent excessively high settings that block all users (e.g., a certain percentage of total supply or a fixed large number like 1 million tokens, depending on tokenomics).

    Example for `setMinStakeAmount(uint256 amount)`:
    ```solidity
    require(amount > 0, "Minimum stake amount cannot be zero");
    require(amount <= MAX_ALLOWED_MIN_STAKE_AMOUNT, "Minimum stake amount exceeds maximum allowed threshold");
    minStakeAmount = amount;
    ```

#### 2. **Configurable Limits (Constants or Admin-Settable)**
Define limits (`MIN_APY_RATE`, `MAX_APY_RATE`, `MAX_ALLOWED_MIN_STAKE_AMOUNT`, etc.) as contract constants or, if they need to be adjustable, as admin-settable state variables. If admin-settable, these limit-setting functions themselves should have strict input validation and ideally be protected by a timelock (as per H-02 finding).

    ```solidity
    // Example constants (adjust PRECISION based on how APY is stored, e.g., 1% = 100 if APY is bps)
    // uint256 public constant MIN_APY_RATE = 100; // e.g., 1% represented as 100 basis points
    // uint256 public constant MAX_APY_RATE = 20000; // e.g., 200% represented as 20000 basis points
    // uint256 public constant MAX_ALLOWED_MIN_STAKE_AMOUNT = 1_000_000 * 1e18; // Example: 1 million tokens with 18 decimals
    ```

#### 3. **Event Emission**

- Emit events for every parameter change, including:
  - The parameter being changed.
  - The old value.
  - The new value.
  - The address of the admin who made the change (`msg.sender`).

#### 4. **Clear Documentation**

- Document all parameter limits (both hardcoded and admin-configurable ranges) and the rationale behind them for transparency and to guide administrators.

---

### PoC Scenarios

#### 1. `updateTierAPY` - Potential Rewards Pool Depletion

- **Scenario:** Admin calls `updateTierAPY(Tier.Tier1, 50000000)` (assuming APY is stored as basis points, this is 500,000% APY).
- **Impact:** If the rewards pool has $100,000 and a significant amount is staked in Tier 1, this extremely high APY could theoretically lead to the rapid depletion of the rewards pool. This would prevent the protocol from meeting its future reward obligations to other stakers, constituting a **loss of funds relevant to the protocol and its users** (loss of future, promised yield). This aligns with Medium severity due to causing a constrained loss of funds under specific admin action.

#### 2. `setMinStakeAmount` - Staking Functionality Breakdown

- **Scenario:** Admin calls `setMinStakeAmount(10**30)` (an astronomically high number, likely far exceeding total token supply).
- **Impact:** Setting `minStakeAmount` to a value that no user can meet (e.g., greater than total supply) renders the `stake()` function unusable for everyone. This **breaks a core functionality** of the staking contract, making it impossible for users to participate. This aligns with Medium severity.

#### 3. `setMinStakeAmount` - Nullifying Constraint

- **Scenario:** Admin calls `setMinStakeAmount(0)`.
- **Impact:** While not directly a loss of funds, setting `minStakeAmount` to zero removes any barrier to entry. This might be undesirable if the protocol intends to prevent dust stakes or ensure only meaningful participation. This could be considered a Low/Info issue on its own but contributes to the pattern of missing validation. For the purpose of this M-01 report, it highlights the lack of lower-bound validation.

---

**Summary:**  
> Robust input validation for admin-controlled parameters is crucial to prevent accidental or malicious configurations that could lead to reward pool depletion, break core contract functionality, or undermine protocol stability. Implementing clear, sensible boundaries, along with transparent eventing and documentation, is essential for secure and predictable protocol administration.
