# A malicious user can drain the layeredgestaking contract

### Summary

As mentioned in the contest readme - 
1) the staking token on Ethereum is  EDGEN
therefore when using the contract on the eth chain the function `completeUnstakeNative` a malicious user can drain the contract by first staking the normal edgen token which is(or can be lower) then the price of ethereum 
then unstake immediately, the problem is that when unstaking the contract puts the same amount on the unstakeRequests mapping regardless of what the x user has staked - either edgen or used the native method 




### Root Cause

the root cause stems from - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L752
as you can see it does not account for the fact that what currency x user has used to stake 


### Internal Pre-conditions

normal protocol conditions

### External Pre-conditions

normal conditions

### Attack Path

1) For this attack path we will usera malicious user named alice
- Alice first uses the function stake  - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L161
lets say for simplicity she staked 1 token (edgen)
- then alice immediately calls unstake - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol
- now after waiting for 1 week for the cooldown now alice calls the function completeUnstakeNative - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L192
this shows alice got 1 eth rather then 1 edgen token she staked(note - as edgen is still not out one could argue its price is uncertain but even if its more then eth this attack could work vice versa)

### Impact

Complete theft of protocols funds

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

use different accounting if x user has staked with native
