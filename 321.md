# Stale Fenwick-Tree Membership After Dynamic `minStakeAmount` Changes

### Summary

The owner can call `setMinStakeAmount(...)` at any time to raise (or lower) the minimum stake threshold. However, existing users who originally crossed the old threshold remain “in-tree” (with their immutable `joinId` and Tier assignments) even if their current balance falls below the new minimum. They keep Tier 1 (or Tier 2) APY privileges until they next call `stake()` or `unstake()`, whereas honest stakers who arrive later will be subject to the new, higher `minStakeAmount`.


### Root Cause

- Tree membership and tier assignment are only evaluated on (a) first stake ≥ `minStakeAmount`, and (b) stake/unstake calls that cross the old threshold.  
- Calling `setMinStakeAmount()` does **not** re-inspect existing users’ balances against the new threshold.  
- Users with `isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake = true` never get reclassified as “out of tree” unless they explicitly stake or unstake again.

    function setMinStakeAmount(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        minStakeAmount = amount;
    }

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `setMinStakeAmount()` updates `minStakeAmount` but does not touch `users[user].outOfTree`, `isActive`, or the Fenwick tree.  
2. `getCurrentTier()` checks only:
   - `user.outOfTree`
   - `!user.isActive || (!user.isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake && user.balance < minStakeAmount)`  
   Users with `isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake == true` bypass the balance check forever.


### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Owner sets `minStakeAmount = 3 000` tokens.  
2. Attacker “A” calls `stake(3 000)` →  
   - `joinId = 1`, `stakerTree.update(1, +1)`  
   - `isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake = true`  
   - Tier = Tier 1 (50% APY).  
3. Owner calls `setMinStakeAmount(20 000)`.  
4. A’s balance (3 000) is now below the new threshold, but:  
   - `outOfTree` remains `false`  
   - `isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake` remains `true`  
   - A stays in the Fenwick tree and Tier 1.  
5. Whale “B” now stakes 50 000 → `joinId = 2` → Tier 2 or Tier 3 (35%/20% APY).  
6. A unfairly continues to earn 50% APY on 3 000 tokens, while honest users are blocked from Tier 1.


### Impact

Users can lock in a high‐APY tier despite falling below the current minimum.  

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In `getCurrentTier()`, treat _any_ current balance < `minStakeAmount` as out-of-tree, regardless of `isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake`.
