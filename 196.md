# attacker can manipulate `stakerCountInTree` and `stakerCountOutOfTree` by unstaking tokens of a non-existent user

### Summary

When calling `unstake` or `unstakeNative` we are not checking whether `UserInfo` actually exists in the storage or not, that allows attacker to call `_unstake` with wallet that was not registered in the system and manipulate `stakerCountInTree` (increase) and `stakerCountOutOfTree` (decrease)

### Root Cause

If `users[userAddr]` is not initialized, we still can bypass all the checks:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L729
```solidity
        //@audit-info pass because both amount and user.balance are 0
        require(user.balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L731
```solidity
        //@audit-info update interest does nothing and just returns because user.balance is zero
        _updateInterest(userAddr);
```
and finally this if condition is entered because `user.outOfTree` is `false` and `user.balance` is less than `minStakeAmount`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L740
```solidity
        if (!user.outOfTree && user.balance < minStakeAmount) {
            // execute this before removing from tree, this will make sure to calculate interest
            //for amount left after unstake
            _recordTierChange(userAddr, Tier.Tier3);
            stakerTree.update(user.joinId, -1);
            stakerCountInTree--; //@audit decrease stakerCountInTree
            user.outOfTree = true;
            stakerCountOutOfTree++; //@audit increase stakerCountOutOfTree
            _checkBoundariesAndRecord(true);
        }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path
Attacker funds `n` amount of wallets and for each one calls `LayerEdgeStaking::unstake`, `stakerCountInTree` will be decrease by `n` and `stakerCountOutTree` increased by `n`

### Impact
- Attacker can mess with ranking system, decreasing `stakerCountInTree` which will affect subsequent `_checkBoundariesAndRecord` and result in unfair tier changes

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

if `user` is not initialized, revert
