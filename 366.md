# Potential arbitrage opportunity while claiming interest

### Summary

The `LayerEdgeStaking` assumes the price of native token and wrapped native token to be always 1:1 and calculates `pendingRewards`/`interestRate` based on the same assumption. This creates arbitrage opportunities as  interest can be claimed in both native and wrapped token as well. 

### Root Cause

The `LayerEdgeStaking` assumes the price of native token and wrapped native token to be always 1:1



### Internal Pre-conditions

The interest rate is calculated here based on amount staked and tier of user  which is calculated [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L463).

So if two users(Alice and Bob)  have staked same amount and belong to the same tier  they would  accur same interest rate. 

Now lets say the price of native token is less than the price of wrapped token. Also we can assume there are enough rewards deposited in staking contract.

Bob sees this opportunity and calls.- 

Note -  On Layeredge L1 network the staking token is weth token 

```solidity
function claimInterest() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        _claimInterest(msg.sender, false);
    }
```

Alice decides to claimInterest in native token by calling following function - 

```solidity 
function claimInterestNative() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        _claimInterest(msg.sender, true);
    }
```

Both the functions call same `_claimInterest` function. 

When [_updateInterest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L780) is called it updates the earned interest of user - 

```solidity 
 function _updateInterest(address userAddr) internal {
        users[userAddr].interestEarned = calculateUnclaimedInterest(userAddr);
    }
```

The `calculateUnclaimedInterest` calculates interest [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L463) and is solely dependent of amount staked and tier.

In this case, Alice and Bob accrue same interest rate as both have staked the same amount and belong to the same tier. 

Here, Bob gains arbitrage as price of Wrapped native token is higher .


 

### External Pre-conditions

Price of native token and wrapped native token is not same on Layeredge L1 network


### Impact

This creates an arbitrage opportunity for stakers. The stakers would claim interest in the token that is currently, at a higher price, as they can claim interest in both native and wrapped token
