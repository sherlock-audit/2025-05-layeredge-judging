# Frequent tier changes via `LayerEdgeStaking::_checkBoundariesAndRecord` would lead to high gas costs and even OOG

### Summary

Frequently calling [`LayerEdgeStaking::_stake`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L674) and [`LayerEdgeStaking::_unstake`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L725) would lead to higher gas costs and even OOG for particular users due to the [`LayerEdgeStaking::_checkBoundariesAndRecord`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L841) call changing tiers as per the given configuration.

### Root Cause

The [`LayerEdgeStaking::_checkBoundariesAndRecord`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L841) call is made inside the [`LayerEdgeStaking::_stake`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L674) and [`LayerEdgeStaking::_unstake`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L725) functions.

However, this particular function acts as a way to ensure the given composition of tier 1 and tier 2 is maintained:
```solidity
    function _checkBoundariesAndRecord(bool isRemoval) internal {
        // recompute thresholds
        uint256 n = stakerCountInTree;
        uint256 oldN = isRemoval ? n + 1 : n - 1;

        // old and new thresholds
        (uint256 old_t1, uint256 old_t2,) = getTierCountForStakerCount(oldN);
        (uint256 new_t1, uint256 new_t2,) = getTierCountForStakerCount(n);

        // Tier 1 boundary handling
        if (new_t1 != 0) {
            if (new_t1 != old_t1) {
                // Need to update all users between the old and new boundaries
                if (new_t1 > old_t1) {
                    // Promotion case: update all users from old_t1+1 to new_t1
                    for (uint256 rank = old_t1 + 1; rank <= new_t1; rank++) {
                        _findAndRecordTierChange(rank, n);        <<@
                    }
                } else {
                    // Demotion case: update all users from new_t1+1 to old_t1
                    for (uint256 rank = new_t1 + 1; rank <= old_t1; rank++) {
                        _findAndRecordTierChange(rank, n);         <<@
                    }
                }
            }
            // Handle case where Tier 1 count stays the same
            else if (isRemoval && new_t1 > 0) {
                _findAndRecordTierChange(new_t1, n);                 <<@
            } else if (!isRemoval) {
                _findAndRecordTierChange(old_t1, n);                   <<@
            }
        }

        // Tier 2 boundary handling
        if (new_t1 + new_t2 > 0) {
            if (new_t2 != old_t2) {
                // Need to update all users between the old and new tier 2 boundaries
                uint256 old_boundary = old_t1 + old_t2;
                uint256 new_boundary = new_t1 + new_t2;

                if (new_boundary > old_boundary) {
                    // Promotion case: update all users from old_boundary+1 to new_boundary
                    for (uint256 rank = old_boundary + 1; rank <= new_boundary; rank++) {
                        _findAndRecordTierChange(rank, n);          <<@
                    }
                } else {
                    // Demotion case: update all users from new_boundary+1 to old_boundary
                    for (uint256 rank = new_boundary + 1; rank <= old_boundary; rank++) {
                        _findAndRecordTierChange(rank, n);                <<@
                    }
                }
            }
            // Handle case where Tier 2 count stays the same
            else if (isRemoval) {
                _findAndRecordTierChange(new_t1 + new_t2, n);      <<@
            } else if (!isRemoval) {
                _findAndRecordTierChange(old_t1 + old_t2, n);           <<@
            }
        }
    }
```

However, this puts burden on the users whose tiers have been changed as [`_findAndRecordTierChange`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L907) calls the [`_recordTierChange`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L817) which adds new tier to the history.

```solidity
    function _findAndRecordTierChange(uint256 rank, uint256 _stakerCountInTree) internal {
        uint256 joinIdCross = stakerTree.findByCumulativeFrequency(rank);
        address userCross = stakerAddress[joinIdCross];
        uint256 _rank = stakerTree.query(joinIdCross);
        Tier toTier = _computeTierByRank(_rank, _stakerCountInTree);
        _recordTierChange(userCross, toTier);
    }
```
```solidity
    function _recordTierChange(address user, Tier newTier) internal {
        . . .
        //push event - ensure neither from nor to is Tier.None
        stakerTierHistory[user].push(TierEvent({from: old, to: newTier, timestamp: currentTime}));       <<@

        . . .
    }
```

This would lead to unnecessarily higher calls inside the [`calculateUnclaimedInterest`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L397) function for that particular user whose tier got changed, which would surely get invoked inside the [`_updateInterest`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L813) function which is being used in almost all state changing functions.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A few users have staked via stake function.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Let's consider an example where the sufficient X stakers inside the tree.

There are two possible ways to execute this attack:-

1. Unknowingly:- 
Users are constantly staking and unstaking which keeps the total number of stakers close to the original number X. Basically oscillating around the number X (high likelihood)

2. Griefing:-
Let's consider a malicious actor continuously stakes and unstakes via different accounts (low likelihood and depends upon the minimum stake)

### Impact

1. Highest impact can be observed for the user who has been continuously being oscillated from one tier to another due to rampant stakes and unstakes taking place.
2. Unfairly high gas costs to particular users.
3. The gas implications would be too high considering the ethereum mainnet.
4. Can even lead to DoS in the long term.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It is recommended to update the interest of the user whose tier is being changed due to the staker number being increased or decrease inside the tree.
