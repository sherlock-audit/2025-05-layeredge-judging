# Tier.None Is Not Handled During Initialization or Downgrade

### Summary

The contract defines a Tier.None value within the Tier enum but fails to explicitly handle or prevent its usage during user initialization or tier transitions. This omission can lead to undefined or unintended tier assignments, polluting the tier history and potentially disrupting reward logic and tier-based operations.



### Root Cause

The Tier enum includes a None value as its first default item. Since Solidity assigns the first enum value by default to uninitialized variables, any uninitialized tier value defaults to Tier.None. However, the contract does not guard against this value being assigned or stored, especially in _recordTierChange, getCurrentTier, and related tier calculation logic.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Tier.None exists as the first value in the enum.

Functions such as _recordTierChange, getCurrentTier, and calculateUnclaimedInterest do not validate tier values or sanitize the input to prevent usage of Tier.None.

Tier events and tier histories are updated even if the tier is Tier.None.



### External Pre-conditions

Any address with uninitialized user state (users[userAddr]) can trigger tier-related logic via public calls like getCurrentTier, stake, or getUserInfo.

An attacker or script can intentionally call these functions on unknown or new addresses to test edge cases involving default values.

### Attack Path

A user or script calls getCurrentTier(address) with a fresh, uninitialized address.

The Tier.None value may be passed or returned internally without validation.

The contract proceeds to record a TierEvent with Tier.None or compute rewards/APY based on undefined logic.

Inconsistent or invalid tier histories are stored and used in further reward calculations or events.

### Impact

Invalid TierEvent records with Tier.None in the from or to fields.

Distorted APY or staking logic due to incorrect tier assignment.

Difficulty in debugging tier transitions and user histories.

Potential reward miscalculations.

Dangerous assumptions for any dApp frontend or analytics platform relying on consistent tier data.



### PoC

```solidity
// A user address that never staked
address uninitialized = address(0x1234);

// getCurrentTier returns Tier.Tier3, but no actual tier set
Tier t = contract.getCurrentTier(uninitialized);

// Internally, tier history for this address is empty or may involve Tier.None
// Then simulate a tier update
contract._recordTierChange(uninitialized, Tier.None); // Will succeed silently

```

### Mitigation

1. Block Tier.None in Tier Events

Add a check in _recordTierChange:
 
```solidity
require(newTier != Tier.None, "Cannot assign Tier.None");
```
2.Sanitize getCurrentTier and Related Logic
Ensure fallback behavior in getCurrentTier explicitly returns a valid tier (Tier1â€“3), and never None.

3.Refactor Enum (optional but safer):

```solidity
enum Tier {
    Invalid, // Explicit invalid value
    Tier1,
    Tier2,
    Tier3
}
```

4.Audit All Tier Usage
Review all areas where Tier values are passed or stored to ensure that Tier.None (or Invalid) is never used in external-facing logic or storage.
