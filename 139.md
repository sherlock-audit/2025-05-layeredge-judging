# High Severity: Unsafe ERC20 transfers – missing return value checks  yaml Copiar Editar

File: edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol
Line: 253
require(stakingToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount), "Token transfer failed");

This line uses transferFrom() directly without wrapping it in a safe transfer abstraction (e.g. OpenZeppelin’s SafeERC20).
Some real-world ERC20 tokens (e.g., USDT, BNB, Tether Gold) do not revert or return a proper bool on failure,
which can lead to silent transfer failures and cause the contract’s internal accounting
(rewardsReserve, user balances, tier assignment) to become inconsistent.
🔐 Impact
Funds may not be transferred as expected.

Users could be credited or debited incorrectly.

Attackers can exploit non-standard tokens to drain or lock funds.

### ✅ Recommendation

Replace direct `transfer()` / `transferFrom()` calls with OpenZeppelin’s `SafeERC20` methods:

```solidity
using SafeERC20 for IERC20;
// ...
stakingToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);

```
