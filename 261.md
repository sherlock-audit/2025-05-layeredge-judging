# If the APY is changed enough times, then all stakes become frozen

### Summary

Before a user can do anything with their stake -- claimInterest, compoundInterest, stake, or unstake -- `_updateInterest` will be called, which calls `calculateUnclaimedInterest`.

`calculateUnclaimedInterest` has a loop that calls `getTierAPYForPeriod`

`getTierAPYForPeriod` in turn loops over all APY changes for that tier.

If there have been enough APY changes, then this causes an out-of-gas error, and no-one is able to unstake or claim interest (or add to an existing stake).

Different users may have their stakes bricked after different numbers of APY changes, depending on the number of tier changes they had. There is another attack where an attacker stakes and unstakes repeatedly in order to cause a user to change tiers more times, causing a separate out-of-gas error. The more APY changes there have been, the fewer tier changes a user needs before their  . These two issues dovetail, but they are ultimately separate -- they are caused by different for loops over different arrays, with different setups needed to cause those arrays to grow.

**This is not admin error.** Any time there is a vulnerability or bug causing permanent loss that requires the admin to make a certain function call, it is tempting to argue that this is an invalid example of admin error. But that is only so when some individual function call has an invalid input or a precondition not met.  There is nothing invalid about calling `updateAllAPYs` or `updateTierAPY` many times, and no amount of ordinary calls to these functions should cause users to suddenly have their funds frozen.

**Note** that there is a very similar issue involving many tier changes which causes the same symptom, except that it can be triggered by anyone, no admin involvement required. While it is also an out-of-gas error in the calculateUnclaimedInterest code path and therefore has the same symptoms, it is ultimately a different issue. Different conditions are needed to set it up, and it stems from a different for loop over a different data structure.





### Root Cause

The root cause is the loop over all APY changes in getTierAPYForPeriod, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L560-L590

Because this function is called from a loop over tier changes for a staker, the more tier changes a staker has, the fewer APY changes need occur before they are bricked.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None. But, the more tier changes a user has, the fewer APY changes are needed before their stake is bricked -- but at some point, all users will have their stakes bricked.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

Non-attack version:

1. For whatever reason, the admins change APY a lot. Maybe they're experiment with small changes, maybe they have a script that runs in a loop. All is well. But then suddenly no-one can withdraw their stake.

Attack version:

1. Eve approaches LayerEdge and asks to do a joint event. As part of this event, there is a promotion where, one week, the interest rates of LayerEdgeStaking are increased every minute. The LayerEdge admins agree, just seeing an exciting event, and not an attack. A few days later, all stakers have lost their money forever.

### Impact

All users can have their stake locked in the contract forever.

I initially submitted this as Medium severity, but, after thinking about the social engineering attack vector above (i.e.: attack can be carried out with no conditions) and the fact that the potential loss is as high as possible, I decided to upgrade my report to High.

### PoC

Add this to TierBoundaryAndInterestTest.t.sol. Bob's call to unstake will fail with an out-of-gas error.  Changing the number 2100 to 2000 will cause it to succeed. This is for 8000000 gas to be allocated to the call to unstake; obviously it will need to be higher to exceed the current Ethereum gas per block limit of 36M.

```solidity
    function test_LayerEdgeStaking_ManyAPYChanges() public {
        // Setup initial 6 stakers
        address[6] memory initialStakers = [alice, bob, charlie, dave, eve, frank];
        
        // Setup initial stakers
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < initialStakers.length; i++) {
            vm.startPrank(initialStakers[i]);
            token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE);
            staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
            vm.stopPrank();
        }

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < 2100; i++) {
            vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1);
            vm.startPrank(admin);
            staking.updateAllAPYs(50 * 1e18, 35 * 1e18, 20 * 1e18);
            vm.stopPrank();
        }

        // Bob attempts to unstake
        vm.startPrank(bob);
        staking.unstake{gas: 8000000}(MIN_STAKE);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```
