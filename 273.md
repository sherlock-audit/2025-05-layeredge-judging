# Users will never be promoted even after staking minstake and being the next to be promoted

### Summary

The maxJoinId value is not decremented when users unstake and leave the system, which causes the Fenwick Tree to maintain an inflated upper bound on the number of active users. As a result, the tree enforces an artificially high maxJoinId constraint, preventing new users from occupying higher tiers. Over time, this can lead to a state where all new users are forced into Tier 3, while Tier 1 and Tier 2 remain empty — effectively breaking the intended tier distribution logic in edge cases.


### Root Cause

When users stake, the Index is incremented always, and when they unstake they retain the join id, but the count is trimmed, id given to them will forever remain, and the user also will be moved to tier 3 permanently.


This creates an issue where join id can be greater than Max user even when the True ACTIVE stakers in tree is lesser.

E.g 
Just for example sake let's say MAX User is 3
ALice stakes, Bob stakes, Harry stakes. 
Alice , bob and harry all unstakes
Jude stakes after all these above users have unstaked and left the contract,
Making Jude the new and only Active stake.
Active count will reflect 1. 
Join id will reflect 4.
 But Jude will forever remain in tier 3 , even if other users join Jude and others will remain in tier 3 because their rank will forever be 0.




### Internal Pre-conditions

1. When a user stakes 



```solidity 

        // If first time staking, register staker position whose stake is more than minStakeAmount
        if (!user.isActive && amount >= minStakeAmount) {
      
@audit>>       user.joinId = nextJoinId++;
  @audit>>           stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1);
@audit>>             stakerAddress[user.joinId] = userAddr;
@audit>>             user.isActive = true;
@audit>>             stakerCountInTree++;

            uint256 rank = stakerTree.query(user.joinId);
            tier = _computeTierByRank(rank, stakerCountInTree);
            user.isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake = true;

@audit>>             _recordTierChange(userAddr, tier);
            _checkBoundariesAndRecord(false);
        }

```

2. When this user unstakes 


```solidity 
        if (!user.outOfTree && user.balance < minStakeAmount) {
            // execute this before removing from tree, this will make sure to calculate interest
            //for amount left after unstake
            _recordTierChange(userAddr, Tier.Tier3);

@audit>>            stakerTree.update(user.joinId, -1);
@audit>>                stakerCountInTree--;
@audit>>                user.outOfTree = true;
@audit>>                stakerCountOutOfTree++;

            _checkBoundariesAndRecord(true);
        }
```


3. Because join id always increases regardless of stake or unstake it doesn't reduce , the library will return a 0 rank for new users even when all of the old users are out of the tree


```solidity 
    struct Tree {
        mapping(uint256 => uint256) data;
        uint256 size;
    }

    function update(Tree storage self, uint256 index, int256 delta) internal {
        require(index > 0, "Index must be > 0");
 
@audit>>       while (index <= self.size) {
            self.data[index] = uint256(int256(self.data[index]) + delta);
            index += lsb(index);
        }
    }

```

Meaning that based on my example above new users after the first 3(MAX) even after their exit will forever be in tier 3.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Users stake 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L701-L708

2. Users unstakes

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L743-L748


3. But the internal joined remains constant 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L701

### Attack Path

1. Users stake to MAX USERS
2. Users who stake initially unstakes allowing new users to move upward
3. But new users will never be promoted to tier 2 or 1 even when they are privileged to move up the ladder
4. Eventually when the first set of users leave the system 
5. The new ones still remain stuck in tier 3 forever. 
6. 0 tier 1 , 0 tier 2 forever .

### Impact

Users will not be promoted at all to tier 2 or 1 even if the Come first, they will never be served. Locking out tier 1 and 2 forever since the Maxuser is hardcoded.

### PoC

Run a test to show how all users will forever be in tier 3 

JUST FOR THE Purpose of this test  to highlight the impact. kindly set MAX USER to 3.

```solidity
  uint256 public constant MAX_USERS = 3 ;//100_000_000
```

```solidity

        assertEq(uint256(staking.getCurrentTier(frank)), uint256(LayerEdgeStaking.Tier.Tier3));
        (,,,,,, bool outOfTree,,) = staking.users(frank);
        assertFalse(outOfTree, "User should be in the tree");

    assertEq(uint256(staking.getCurrentTier(david)), uint256(LayerEdgeStaking.Tier.Tier3));

### Mitigation
FIX not trivial.
The index used by each user in the tree should be based on their position in the first-come, first-served order. We can use another index to monitor users' positions in the tree, meaning that if the join ID is 10 but the first 9 have unstaked, user 10 should have the index position of 1 as long as they stake above the minimum and are in the tree.
