# protocol will break tier assignments for stakers due to unupdated Fenwick Tree size

### Summary

The staking contract fails to update the Fenwick Tree’s size parameter when new users join.
This will cause incorrect tier assignments for stakers, as the tree cannot track ranks beyond its initial size.
Stakers will receive improper APY rewards.
The admin (or protocol) will unintentionally disrupt the system by allowing new users to join without tree resizing.

### Root Cause

In the LayerEdgestaking _stake function, stakerCountInTree is incremented when users join, but the Fenwick Tree’s size is never updated.
Example: If the tree is initialized with size = 100, user 101 will cause out-of-bounds errors in stakerTree.update() and stakerTree.query()

### Internal Pre-conditions

Admin deploys the staking contract with a fixed MAX_USERS limit (e.g., 100,000,000).

The Fenwick Tree’s size is initialized but not dynamically updated.

Stakers join beyond the initial tree size (e.g., user 101 joins a tree of size 100).

### External Pre-conditions

The staking pool reaches its initial tree capacity (e.g., 100 users).

New stakers attempt to deposit after the tree is full.



### Attack Path

Admin deploys the contract with MAX_USERS = 100 (for simplicity).

100 users stake tokens, filling the Fenwick Tree.

User 101 stakes tokens:

stakerCountInTree increments to 101.

stakerTree.update(101, 1) is called, but the tree’s size remains 100.

The tree silently fails or returns incorrect ranks for queries.



### Impact

Stakers suffer incorrect APY rewards due to corrupted tier assignments

Protocol loses fairness guarantees (20%/30%/50% tier distribution)

Loss: Non-quantifiable but systemic (affects all future stakers)

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Dynamic Tree Resizing: Update the Fenwick Tree’s size in _stake when stakerCountInTree exceeds the current size.
```solidity
if (stakerCountInTree > stakerTree.size) {
    stakerTree.size = stakerCountInTree;
}
```

Bounds Checking: Revert if stakerCountInTree > MAX_USERS.
