# APY‐Change and Claim Race: Zero‐Duration or Double‐Count Interest Windows

## Title  
APY‐Change and Claim Race: Zero‐Duration or Double‐Count Interest Windows

## Summary  
When an admin updates a tier’s APY (`updateTierAPY`) and a user claims interest (`claimInterest`) in the same block, both actions use `block.timestamp` as the boundary. Because the new `APYPeriod.startTime` can equal the user’s `lastClaimTime`, the interest‐calculation logic may (a) skip a tiny segment of time entirely or (b) misattribute it to the old rate—depending on loop ordering and `≤`/`<` comparisons.

## Root Cause  
- `updateTierAPY` appends a new `APYPeriod` with `startTime = block.timestamp`.  
- A simultaneous `claimInterest` reads `fromTime = user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp` (set by a previous action, or default).  
- In `getTierAPYForPeriod`, the adjustment  
  ```solidity
  if (startTime < apyPeriods[0].startTime) 
      startTime = apyPeriods[0].startTime;
  ```  
  plus the per‐period loops may yield zero `duration` for the intended slice, or mis‐assign it entirely to the old/new period.

## Internal Pre-conditions  
1. `tierAPYHistory[tier].push(APYPeriod({rate: newRate, startTime: block.timestamp}));`  
2. `calculateUnclaimedInterest` uses `user.lastClaimTime` and `block.timestamp` unaltered.  
3. No guard against equal timestamps or microsecond offsets.

## External Pre-conditions  
1. The admin calls `updateTierAPY(...)` at block N.  
2. In block N (same timestamp), a user calls `claimInterest()` or `calculateUnclaimedInterest()` (via `getUserInfo`, etc.).

## Attack Path  
1. Block N starts at time T.  
2. TX₁ (admin): `updateTierAPY(Tier1, newRate)` → appends `(startTime=T)`.  
3. TX₂ (user, mined same block): `claimInterest()` calls `_updateInterest() → calculateUnclaimedInterest`:  
   - `fromTime = user.lastClaimTime = T`  
   - `apyPeriods[0].startTime = T`  
   - The logic may compute `duration = 0` or incorrectly assign the infinitesimal `[T,T]` slice.  
4. As a result, the interest for that tiny interval is dropped or mis‐rated.

## Impact  
- Users may lose (or rarely—gain) a few seconds’ worth of interest at the intended APY rate.  
- Admin could “soft‐throttle” interest accrual for a brief moment by timing APY updates, causing stale or unfavorable rate application.  
- Undermines precision and fairness of interest accounting.

## Mitigation  
1. **Disallow Equality**  
   - When recording a new period, set `startTime = block.timestamp + 1` (or `block.timestamp - 1` for the previous period’s end).  
2. **Use `>` vs. `>=` Consistently**  
   - In `getTierAPYForPeriod`, require strict inequalities to ensure any slice has non‐zero duration in exactly one bucket.  
3. **Timestamp Offsets**  
   - In `updateTierAPY`, record both `startTime` and an explicit `endTime` for the previous period to avoid overlap/gaps.  
4. **Per‐Block Sequencer**  
   - Track per‐block counters to serialize APY‐changes vs. claims, e.g. reject `claimInterest` in the same block as an `updateTierAPY`.  
5. **Event‐Based Reconciliation**  
   - On APY updates, emit an event that off‐chain indexing systems can use to recompute precise per‐user interest, and let users dispute on‐chain deviations.
