# User Permanently Locked into Tier 3 if Initial Stake is Below `minStakeAmount`

### Summary

Users making their first stake below `minStakeAmount` are permanently assigned to Tier 3, irrespective of subsequent larger stakes.

-   [In ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L674)`_stake()`:
    -   If a user's first stake (`!user.isActive`) is less than `minStakeAmount`:
        -   `user.outOfTree` is set to `true`.
        -   `user.isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake` remains `false` (its default).
        -   The user is not added to the `stakerTree` (which is used for Tier 1 and Tier 2 eligibility).
    -   These flags (`outOfTree` and `isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake`) are critical for tier determination and are not reset or re-evaluated on subsequent stakes.
-   In `getCurrentTier()`:
    -   The check `if (user.outOfTree)` returns `Tier.Tier3` immediately.
    -   This means if `outOfTree` is `true`, the user's current `balance` or their `isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake` status (if it could change) is not considered further for tier assignment beyond Tier 3.

This logic ensures that an initial small stake permanently classifies the user as `outOfTree` and thus Tier 3, even if their total staked amount later significantly exceeds `minStakeAmount`.

### Root Cause

-   **Permanent Flagging:** An initial stake below `minStakeAmount` irrevocably sets `user.outOfTree = true`.
-   **Immutable Initial Condition Check:** `user.isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake` is only set during the first deposit and never updated.
-   **Lack of State Re-evaluation:** The contract does not re-evaluate a user's `outOfTree` status or eligibility for the `stakerTree` upon subsequent stakes that might meet the `minStakeAmount` criteria in total.
-   **Prioritized `outOfTree` Check:** `getCurrentTier()`'s primary condition for Tier 3 assignment is `user.outOfTree`, which overrides other considerations for users flagged this way.

### Internal Pre-conditions

-   `minStakeAmount` is set to a value > 0.
-   For the user (`msg.sender`), `users[msg.sender].isActive == false` (i.e., it's their first staking action).

### External Pre-conditions

-   User calls `stake(amount)` or `stakeNative()` where the initial `amount < minStakeAmount`.

### Attack Path

1.  **New User, Small Initial Stake:** Alice (a new staker, `users[Alice].isActive == false`) stakes an `amount` that is less than `minStakeAmount`.
    -   In `_stake()`: `users[Alice].outOfTree` becomes `true`. `users[Alice].isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake` remains `false`. Alice is not added to `stakerTree`.
2.  **Subsequent Larger Stake:** Alice later stakes an `additionalAmount`, making her total `users[Alice].balance` greater than or equal to `minStakeAmount`.
    -   During this second stake, `users[Alice].isActive` is now `true`. The logic paths for new stakers (which add to `stakerTree` and set `isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake`) are skipped.
    -   `users[Alice].outOfTree` remains `true`.
3.  **Tier Check:** Any call to `getCurrentTier(Alice)` will first check `if (users[Alice].outOfTree)`. Since this is `true`, the function returns `Tier.Tier3`.

Alice is now permanently in Tier 3, regardless of her total staked balance.

### Impact

-   **Permanent Lower Rewards:** Users are locked into Tier 3 APY, unable to access higher tiers (Tier 1, Tier 2) even if their total stake later substantially exceeds `minStakeAmount`.
-   **Discourages Trial Stakes:** Penalizes users who might make a small initial stake to test the system before committing larger amounts.
-   **Poor User Experience:** This behavior is counter-intuitive. Users expect that increasing their stake to meet requirements would improve their tier. The permanence can lead to frustration.
-   **Reduced Protocol Attractiveness:** The strict and irreversible nature of this condition may make the protocol less appealing compared to others offering more flexible tier progression.
