# Address potential DoS in LayerEdgeStaking tier logic

summary: "The iterative updates to `stakerTierHistory` will cause a Denial of Service (DoS) for all users as legitimate stakers will encounter transactions reverting due to excessive gas costs during tier boundary recalculations."
root: "In [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L621-L659](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L621-L659), the `_checkBoundariesAndRecord` function contains `for` loops that iterate over potentially many user ranks and call `_findAndRecordTierChange`. This function, in turn, calls `_recordTierChange`, which performs a storage write (`SSTORE`) to update `stakerTierHistory`. This design choice becomes a mistake as a large number of affected users will lead to cumulative gas costs exceeding the block gas limit."

  1. `stakerCountInTree` needs to be sufficiently large (e.g., thousands or tens of thousands of active stakers).
  2. A `stake` or `unstake` operation (calling `_stake` or `_unstake`) occurs, causing a change in `stakerCountInTree`.
  3. The change in `stakerCountInTree` must result in a recalculation of tier boundaries (`new_t1` != `old_t1` or `new_t1 + new_t2` != `old_t1 + old_t2` in `_checkBoundariesAndRecord`) that affects a significant number of users, leading to many iterations in the `for` loops within `_checkBoundariesAndRecord`.

  None directly.
attack: |
  This is a **vulnerability path** that can be triggered by a legitimate user's action or potentially exploited by an attacker to cause a DoS.
  1. The staking pool accumulates a large number of active stakers (e.g., `stakerCountInTree` reaches 50,000 users or more).
  2. A user (can be a legitimate staker or an attacker) sends a transaction to `stake(amount)` or `unstake(amount)`.
  3. This transaction executes `_stake` or `_unstake`, which calls `_checkBoundariesAndRecord(isRemoval)`.
  4. Inside `_checkBoundariesAndRecord`, new tier thresholds are computed. If these thresholds cause a significant number of existing users to transition between tiers, the nested `for` loops will iterate a large number of times.
  5. For each iteration, `_findAndRecordTierChange` is called, which then calls `_recordTierChange`.
  6. `_recordTierChange` pushes a new `TierEvent` to `stakerTierHistory[user]`, which is a `SSTORE` operation (approximately 5000-20000 gas, depending on hot/cold storage).
  7. If hundreds or thousands of users are affected (e.g., if the `stakerCountInTree` is very large, a percentage shift can cause a large group of users to cross a boundary), the cumulative gas cost will quickly exceed the Ethereum block gas limit (currently ~30 million gas).
  8. This will cause the transaction to `revert` with an "out of gas" error.
  9. Consequently, all subsequent `stake` or `unstake` transactions (and potentially `compoundInterest` if it triggers `_updateInterest` indirectly) that attempt to modify `stakerCountInTree` and trigger a large boundary shift will fail, effectively halting the core staking functionalities of the contract.
impact: "The {LayerEdgeStaking protocol} suffers a {Denial of Service} as users cannot execute core staking functions like `stake` and `unstake`. This leads to a complete loss of functionality, prevents new participation, locks existing funds (until an upgrade or manual intervention is performed), and severely damages user trust and the protocol's reputation. There is no direct financial loss *from the reverted transaction itself*, but the inability to interact with the contract represents a significant operational and reputational loss."
