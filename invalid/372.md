# Users may unexpectedly incur financial losses due to high gas fees

### Summary
Whenever users interact with the protocol, it calculates the accrued interest and updates the `UserInfo.interestEarned`. The calculation process involves two iterations: the first iterates over the user's tier history (`userTierHistory[userAddr]`), and the second iterates over the array of APY history (`apyPeriods[tier]`). It's important to note that a user's tier history can be modified by others, regardless of the user's intent. Consequently, the length of the user's tier history can be quite large, leading to significant gas costs during iteration. This is particularly concerning since the protocol is deployed on Ethereum, where users may experience financial losses due to high gas fees. In extreme cases, user interactions might even be reverted due to OOG.

### Root Cause
In the function [calculateUnclaimedInterest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L397), at [L451](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L451), it iterates over the user's tier history. Then, at [L461](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L461), it iterates over the APY history associated with the user's tier.
```solidity
        // Then process any subsequent tier changes within our calculation window
 @>     for (uint256 i = relevantStartIndex + 1; i < userTierHistory.length; i++) {
            if (userTierHistory[i].timestamp >= toTime) break;

            periodStart = userTierHistory[i].timestamp;
            periodEnd = (i == userTierHistory.length - 1) ? toTime : userTierHistory[i + 1].timestamp;
            if (periodEnd > toTime) periodEnd = toTime;

            if (periodEnd <= periodStart) continue;

            Tier periodTier = userTierHistory[i].to;
 @>         uint256 apy = getTierAPYForPeriod(periodTier, periodStart, periodEnd);

            uint256 periodInterest =
                ((user.balance * apy * (periodEnd - periodStart)) / (SECONDS_IN_YEAR * PRECISION)) / 100;
            totalInterest += periodInterest;
        }
```

Since a user's tier can be modified whenever other users interact with the protocol, the length of the array may become quite large.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Impact
Users may incur financial losses due to high gas fees. If the length of the array is substantial, a user's interactions with the protocol (such as `stake`, `unstake`, or `claimInterest`) could be reverted.

### Mitigation
It is recommended to  limit the number of iterations to a fixed value.
