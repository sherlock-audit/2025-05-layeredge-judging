# Insufficient ETH Balance in WETH9 Causing Denial-of-Service

### Summary

The missing ETH balance check in WETH9.sol will cause a denial-of-service for stakers as an attacker can manipulate the ETH balance, preventing users from completing unstake or claim actions in LayerEdgeStaking.sol.

### Root Cause

In WETH9.sol at the withdraw function, there is a missing check to ensure the contract’s ETH balance (address(this).balance) is sufficient before transferring ETH to the user. The line payable(msg.sender).transfer(wad) assumes adequate ETH is available, but if the balance is drained, the transfer fails, causing a revert. This affects LayerEdgeStaking.sol’s completeUnstakeNative and claimInterestNative functions, which rely on WETH9.withdraw.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The WETH9.sol contract must have an initial ETH balance from user deposits.
An attacker needs to manipulate the ETH balance to reduce WETH9.sol’s available ETH below the withdrawal amount.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

An attacker calls selfdestruct from a malicious contract, forcing ETH into LayerEdgeStaking.sol or draining WETH9.sol’s ETH balance indirectly.
A user calls completeUnstakeNative or claimInterestNative in LayerEdgeStaking.sol, triggering WETH9.withdraw, which reverts due to insufficient ETH.
The transaction fails, preventing the user from accessing their staked funds or rewards.

### Impact

The stakers suffer an inability to execute unstake or claim actions, locking their funds for an approximate period exceeding 1 week. The attacker does not gain financially but can disrupt protocol functionality.

    }
}

### Mitigation

Modify WETH9.withdraw to include an ETH balance check.

function withdraw(uint256 wad) public {
    require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= wad, "Insufficient balance");
    require(address(this).balance >= wad, "Insufficient ETH");
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= wad;
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(wad);
    emit Withdrawal(msg.sender, wad);
}
