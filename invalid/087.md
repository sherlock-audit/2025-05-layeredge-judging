# User Permanently Assigned to Tier 3 After Balance Drops Below `minStakeAmount` or Initial Stake is Too Low

### Summary

A user is permanently assigned to `Tier.Tier3` if their initial stake is [below ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L106)`minStakeAmount` or if they unstake tokens causing their staked balance to fall below `minStakeAmount`. Once the `user.outOfTree` flag is set to `true` under these conditions, the `getCurrentTier()` function will always return `Tier.Tier3` for this user. There is no mechanism for the user to re-enter the Fenwick tree-based tiering (Tiers 1 or 2) by subsequently staking more tokens to exceed `minStakeAmount`.


### Root Cause

1.  In `_stake()`: If `!user.isActive && amount < minStakeAmount`, `user.outOfTree` is set to `true`.
2.  In `_unstake()`: If `!user.outOfTree && user.balance < minStakeAmount` (after unstaking), `user.outOfTree` is set to `true`.
3.  The `getCurrentTier()` function checks `if (user.outOfTree)` first and returns `Tier.Tier3` if true, without considering current balance or subsequent stakes.
4.  There is no functionality to reset `user.outOfTree` to `false` once it has been set to `true`.


### Internal Pre-conditions

*   For initial stake scenario: `users[msg.sender].isActive` is `false`.
*   For unstake scenario: `users[msg.sender].isActive` is `true`, `users[msg.sender].outOfTree` is `false`, and `users[msg.sender].balance` (after unstaking the requested amount) is less than `minStakeAmount`.
*   The `minStakeAmount` variable is set to a positive value.

### External Pre-conditions

*   For initial stake scenario: A user calls `stake()` or `stakeNative()` with an `amount` less than `minStakeAmount` as their first staking transaction.
*   For unstake scenario: An active user calls `unstake()` with an `amount` that reduces their staked balance to below `minStakeAmount`.

### Attack Path

This is more of a permanent state change with economic implications rather than a direct attack by a malicious actor.
1.  **Scenario A (Initial Under-Stake):**
    *   User A stakes an amount `X` where `X < minStakeAmount`.
    *   `users[A].outOfTree` is set to `true`. `getCurrentTier(A)` returns `Tier.Tier3`.
    *   User A later stakes an additional amount `Y` such that `X + Y > minStakeAmount`.
    *   `users[A].outOfTree` remains `true`. `getCurrentTier(A)` still returns `Tier.Tier3`.
2.  **Scenario B (Unstake Below Threshold):**
    *   User B stakes an amount `Z` where `Z > minStakeAmount`. `users[B].outOfTree` is `false`. They are eligible for Tier 1 or 2.
    *   User B unstakes an amount `U` such that `Z - U < minStakeAmount`.
    *   `users[B].outOfTree` is set to `true`. `getCurrentTier(B)` returns `Tier.Tier3`.
    *   User B later stakes an additional amount `W` such that `(Z - U) + W > minStakeAmount`.
    *   `users[B].outOfTree` remains `true`. `getCurrentTier(B)` still returns `Tier.Tier3`.


### Impact

*   **Permanent Lower Rewards:** Users who trigger the `outOfTree` condition are permanently relegated to `Tier.Tier3`, which typically offers the lowest APY. Even if they later increase their stake significantly above `minStakeAmount`, they cannot achieve a higher tier (Tier 1 or Tier 2) and thus miss out on potentially higher rewards.
*   **Reduced Staking Incentive:** This permanent restriction can disincentivize users from re-staking or increasing their stake after falling into this category, as the reward potential remains capped at Tier 3.
*   **Unintuitive User Experience:** Users might not expect that an initial small stake or a temporary dip below `minStakeAmount` due to unstaking would permanently affect their tier eligibility for all future staking activities in the contract. This can lead to user dissatisfaction if not clearly communicated.
*   **Fenwick Tree Exclusion:** The user is removed from the `stakerTree` (`stakerTree.update(user.joinId, -1)` in `_unstake()`), meaning they no longer influence the tier boundaries for other users and are not considered in `stakerCountInTree` for tier calculations.
