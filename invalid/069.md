# [Medium] Missing balance check in depositRewards

### Summary

Admin might not have tokens.

No test function 

Transfer fails silently 

No error catching


The staking contract allows reward deposits via depositRewards() without verifying the caller’s token balance or implementing strict access controls. This can lead to test failures or, in production, unauthorized reward manipulation by a compromised or malicious admin. The lack of proper token funding in the test environment further masks these issues. To prevent this, the contract should enforce stricter access and funding 



### Root Cause

The depositRewards() function in the LayerEdgeStaking contract assumes that the admin has sufficient token balance and that any call from the admin is trustworthy. However, there is no internal validation to ensure that the caller truly holds the approved reward amount or that the rewards are being deposited from a verified, audited source. Additionally, the test setup itself fails to ensure the admin is funded before calling this function, leading to silent test failures or inconsistent results.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The staking contract allows rewards to be deposited via staking.depositRewards().

The stakingToken (LayerEdgeToken) has an approve() + transferFrom() flow.

Admin is a role (perhaps via Ownable or AccessControl), assumed trusted.

### External Pre-conditions

• admin has insufficient tokens in their balance during test setup.
• The LayerEdgeToken does not enforce role-based minting restrictions, or admin can obtain tokens arbitrarily.
• No validation exists in depositRewards() to ensure minimum contract funding or fair distribution logic.

### Attack Path

• A malicious admin or compromised key calls approve() on the token contract for a large amount.
• Then calls staking.depositRewards() with arbitrary large amount.
• If reward distribution depends on this value, it may disrupt rewards, over-inflate pool, or cause a denial-of-reward attack by locking massive amounts.

### Impact

• Potential DoS on fair reward distribution.
• Pool may be overwhelmed by unaudited rewards.
• If reward logic uses total rewards to calculate APR/APY, it may mislead users or manipulate compounding benefits.
• In test cases, this leads to false positives if admin doesn't have enough tokens, but function still succeeds or fails silently.

### PoC

function testDepositWithoutBalance() public { vm.startPrank(admin); // Deliberately avoid minting or transferring tokens to admin uint256 fakeRewardAmount = 1_000_000 * 1e18; // More than actual balance token.approve(address(staking), fakeRewardAmount); vm.expectRevert("ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance"); // Add if checking staking.depositRewards(fakeRewardAmount); vm.stopPrank(); } 

### Mitigation

Ensure the depositRewards() checks that msg.sender has sufficient token balance.
• Limit who can call depositRewards() with onlyOwner or role-based access control.
•  Add logging and validation in the staking contract to prevent over-deposit.
•  Improve test setup to mint or assign tokens to admin before approving/depositing.
• In production, perform audit to check reward flow boundaries and reentrancy protections.
