# Users with nextjoinId > MAX_USERS Are Not Tracked Properly

### Summary

When `nextJoinId` exceeds `MAX_USERS` (100,000,000), new stakers are not tracked in the Fenwick tree.

### Root Cause

The contract uses a Fenwick tree (with MAX_USERS = 100,000,000) to track and rank active stakers by their joinId. However, `nextJoinId` is allowed to grow indefinitely as users join and leave. When `nextJoinId` exceeds `MAX_USERS`, new users are assigned a joinId that is outside the bounds of the Fenwick tree. As a result:

- `stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1)` does nothing for these users (they are not tracked in the tree).
- `stakerTree.query(user.joinId)` returns the total number of in-tree stakers, not the user's actual rank.
- Tier assignment and boundary logic become incorrect for these users.
- Functions that rely on the Fenwick tree for rank, tier, or user discovery will misbehave for overflow users.

### Internal Pre-conditions

 `nextJoinId` exceeds `MAX_USERS`  due to user turnover. 

### External Pre-conditions

Project attracting many users for a long period of time.

### Attack Path

1. Many users join and leave, causing `nextJoinId` to increase steadily.
2. Eventually, `nextJoinId` exceeds `MAX_USERS` (100,000,000).
3. New users who stake after this point get a joinId above the Fenwick tree’s size.
4. These users are not tracked in the tree: their rank and tier logic is broken, and they are not included in tier boundary updates or discoverable by rank.
5. The contract’s tier and reward system becomes inconsistent and unfair for all overflow users.

### Impact

New stakers with joinId > MAX_USERS are not tracked. They are invisible to tier boundary logic, not discoverable by rank, and not included in tier promotions/demotions. Those users will be in Tier3 forever.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

 Contract should prevent staking when `nextJoinId` > MAX_USERS or handle joinId recycling to ensure all users are tracked and ranked properly.
