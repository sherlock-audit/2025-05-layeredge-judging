# Missing Emergency Withdrawal Methods in LayerEdgeStaking Contract

### Summary

The LayerEdgeStaking contract lacks emergency withdrawal methods for both native ETH and ERC20 tokens. This means that any native ETH or ERC20 tokens accidentally sent to the contract will be permanently locked, as there is no mechanism to recover these funds.


### Root Cause

The contract only implements withdrawal functionality for the staking token (WETH) through the `withdrawRewards` function, which is restricted to the owner. There are no functions to handle emergency withdrawals of native ETH or other ERC20 tokens that might be sent to the contract by mistake.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

Contract must be deployed and operational
Someone must accidentally send native ETH or ERC20 tokens to the contract

### Attack Path

#### Accidental Native ETH Transfer:

- User or contract accidentally sends native ETH to the LayerEdgeStaking contract
- The receive() function only accepts ETH from the staking token (WETH)
- The ETH becomes permanently locked in the contract

#### Accidental ERC20 Transfer:

- User or contract accidentally sends an ERC20 token to the LayerEdgeStaking contract
- The contract has no function to withdraw non-staking tokens
- The ERC20 tokens become permanently locked in the contract

### Impact

High Severity: Permanent loss of funds
Financial Impact: Any accidentally sent native ETH or ERC20 tokens cannot be recovered

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement emergency withdrawal functions:


```solidity
function emergencyWithdrawETH() external onlyOwner {
    uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
    require(balance > 0, "No ETH to withdraw");
    (bool success,) = payable(owner()).call{value: balance}("");
    require(success, "ETH transfer failed");
}

function emergencyWithdrawERC20(address token) external onlyOwner {
    require(token != address(stakingToken), "Cannot withdraw staking token");
    uint256 balance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
    require(balance > 0, "No tokens to withdraw");
    require(IERC20(token).transfer(owner(), balance), "Token transfer failed");
}
```
