# Protocol will assign invalid tiers to stakers due to Fenwick Tree frequency overflow

### Summary

The findByCumulativeFrequency function in the Fenwick Tree library returns invalid join IDs for ranks exceeding total stakers.
This will cause failed tier assignments for edge-case stakers as the protocol will attempt to look up non-existent user addresses.
Stakers with ranks near the total staker count will receive incorrect tier assignments.
The protocol's tier calculation system will malfunction during boundary conditions.

### Root Cause

In FenwickTree.sol, the findByCumulativeFrequency function returns idx + 1 even when the requested rank exceeds the total staker count.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/library/FenwickTree.sol#L29
Example: For 100 stakers, querying rank 101 returns joinId 101, which doesn't exist in stakerAddress mapping.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The staking contract has exactly N active stakers in the tree.

The protocol attempts to calculate tier boundaries for rank N+1 (edge case).

The Fenwick Tree contains no bounds checking for frequency queries.

### External Pre-conditions

The staking pool approaches its maximum capacity.

Tier boundary calculations occur during periods of high staker churn.

### Attack Path

Protocol reaches exactly 100 stakers in the tree.

System calculates tier boundaries:

Tier 1 cutoff at rank 20 (20% of 100)

Tier 2 cutoff at rank 50 (20%+30%)

During boundary calculation, findByCumulativeFrequency(101) is called.

Function returns joinId 101, which maps to address(0).

Tier assignment fails for affected stakers.

### Impact

Stakers near tier boundaries suffer incorrect APY rewards due to failed tier assignments.

Protocol loses tier distribution accuracy (20%/30%/50% guarantees fail).

Loss: Non-quantifiable but affects fairness for top-ranked stakers.

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../src/FenwickTree.sol";

contract FenwickTreeTest is Test {
    FenwickTree.Tree tree;

    function setUp() public {
        tree.size = 100;
        // Initialize tree with 100 stakers (simplified)
        for (uint i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
            tree.update(i, 1);
        }
    }

    function test_FrequencyOverflow() public {
        // Query rank 101 (should fail)
        uint invalidJoinId = tree.findByCumulativeFrequency(101);
        assertGt(invalidJoinId, tree.size); // Returns 101 when size=100
        
        // This would fail in main contract:
        // address invalidUser = stakerAddress[invalidJoinId]; // Returns address(0)
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Add Bounds Checking :
```solidity
function findByCumulativeFrequency(Tree storage self, uint256 freq) internal view returns (uint256) {
    require(freq <= self.query(self.size), "Rank exceeds total stakers");
    // ... existing logic ...
}
```

Safe Tier Calculation :
```solidity
function _computeTierByRank(uint256 rank, uint256 totalStakers) internal pure returns (Tier) {
    if (rank == 0 || rank > totalStakers) return Tier.Tier3; // Explicit handling
    // ... existing tier logic ...
}
```
