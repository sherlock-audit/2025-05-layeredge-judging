# Staking and Unstaking with Token Conversion Exploit

## Summary
The `LayerEdgeStaking` contract allows users to stake ERC20 tokens and later unstake them to receive native tokens. This creates an arbitrage opportunity where users can exploit the price difference between the ERC20 staking token and the native token, potentially leading to a loss for the protocol.

## Vulnerability Details
- **Type**: Arbitrage Exploit
- **Severity**: High
- **Components Affected**: `stake`, `unstake`, `completeUnstakeNative`
- **Impact**: Users can profit by exploiting the price difference between the ERC20 staking token and the native token, resulting in a financial loss for the protocol.

### Exploit Scenario

1. **Staking**:
   - The user calls the [LayerEdgeStaking::stake](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L161) function to deposit a certain amount of ERC20 staking tokens into the contract.
   - The user's balance in the contract is updated, and they start earning interest based on their tier.

```Solidity
    /**
     * @notice Stake tokens
     * @param amount Amount to stake
     */
    function stake(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        _stake(amount, msg.sender, false);
    }
```

2. **Unstaking**:
   - After a specific period, the user calls the [LayerEdgeStaking::unstake](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L176) function to initiate the unstaking process.
   - An unstake request is created, and the user's balance is reduced by the unstaked amount.

```Solidity
    /**
     * @notice Unstake tokens
     * @param amount Amount to unstake
     */
    function unstake(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        _unstake(amount, msg.sender);
    }
```

3. **Completing Unstake with Native Tokens**:
   - Once the unstake window is reached, the user calls the [LayerEdgeStaking::completeUnstakeNative](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L192) function.
   - The user receives the unstaked amount plus any accrued rewards in `Native tokens` instead of the original ERC20 tokens.

```Solidity
    /**
     * @notice Complete a specific unstake request with native token
     * @param index Index of the unstake request to complete
     */
    function completeUnstakeNative(uint256 index) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        _completeUnstake(msg.sender, index, true);
    }

    function _completeUnstake(address userAddr, uint256 index, bool isNative) internal {
        UnstakeRequest[] storage requests = unstakeRequests[userAddr];
        require(index < requests.length, "Invalid unstake request index");

        UnstakeRequest storage request = requests[index];
        require(!request.completed, "Unstake request already completed");
        require(block.timestamp >= request.timestamp + UNSTAKE_WINDOW, "Unstaking window not reached");

        request.completed = true;

        // Transfer tokens back to user
        if (!isNative) {
            require(stakingToken.transfer(userAddr, request.amount), "Token transfer failed");
        } else {
            IWETH(address(stakingToken)).withdraw(request.amount);
            (bool success,) = payable(userAddr).call{value: request.amount}("");  ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ // @audit - it is directly sending the request.amount as native but not considering that the user stake that in normal stake tokens
            require(success, "Unstake native transfer failed");
        }

        emit Unstaked(userAddr, request.amount);
    }
```

4. **Profit Realization**:
   - If the native token's market value is higher than the ERC20 staking token, the user can sell the native tokens for a profit.
   - The protocol incurs a loss as it effectively pays out more value than it received.
   - Most of the time, the Native tokens price will be higher than the erc20 token define here. Like the ETH price will be always higher.

#### Steps to Exploit
1. **Stake ERC20 Tokens**:
   - Call the `stake` function with a specified amount of ERC20 tokens.
   - Ensure the amount is above the minimum stake requirement to earn interest.

2. **Wait for Interest Accrual**:
   - Allow time for interest to accrue based on the user's tier and APY rates.

3. **Initiate Unstake**:
   - Call the `unstake` function with the desired amount to unstake.
   - Wait for the unstake window to pass.

4. **Complete Unstake with Native Tokens**:
   - Call the `completeUnstakeNative` function to receive the unstaked amount and rewards in native tokens.

5. **Sell Native Tokens**:
   - Sell the received native tokens on the open market for a higher value than the original ERC20 tokens.

### The user can also do the opposite.
If he sees that the ERC20 token price is higher than the Native token, So he will stake with Native Tokens and Unstake with `stakeTokens`

## Recommendations

What you can do is track the `balance` of a user with two variables. One with normal token `stakeTokenBalance` and another `nativeTokenBalance`

Also, you can do,
- **Token Consistency**: Ensure that the staking and unstaking processes use the same token type to prevent conversion arbitrage.
- **Price Oracle Integration**: Implement a price oracle to adjust the conversion rate between ERC20 and native tokens dynamically.
- **Protocol Controls**: Introduce controls to limit the amount of native tokens that can be withdrawn relative to the staked ERC20 tokens.

By addressing these issues, the protocol can prevent users from exploiting the price differences between token types and protect its financial integrity.
