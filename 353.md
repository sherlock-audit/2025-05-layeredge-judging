# Precision Loss in Interest Calculation

### Summary

The interest calculation logic in the `LayerEdgeStaking::calculateUnclaimedInterest` function can lose precision due to Solidityâ€™s integer division, especially for short durations or small balances.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L443-L448

### Root Cause

In the `LayerEdgeStaking::calculateUnclaimedInterest` function, interest is calculated as follows:
```solidity
uint256 periodInterest =
    ((user.balance * apy * (periodEnd - periodStart)) / (SECONDS_IN_YEAR * PRECISION)) / 100;
```
If the computed value inside the parentheses is less than `SECONDS_IN_YEAR * PRECISION`, the result of the division will truncate to zero. This is more likely to happen when the time period is short or the balance is small.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- `user.balance`, `apy`, and `duration` (i.e., `periodEnd - periodStart`) result in a product too small compared to `SECONDS_IN_YEAR * PRECISION * 100`, causing the computed `periodInterest` to be truncated to zero due to solidity integer division.

### External Pre-conditions

- The user has a small stake or claims rewards frequently.
- The contract allows claiming rewards at arbitrary time intervals without enforcing minimum thresholds that accumulate interest before calculation.

### Attack Path

A user interacts with the staking contract and regularly claims rewards over short intervals. Each time `LayerEdgeStaking::calculateUnclaimedInterest` is called, the interest earned over that short duration is calculated. Due to rounding during integer division, any small but valid interest gets truncated to zero, leading to underpayment.

### Impact

This leads to users receiving little interest even though they may be eligible for more. The longer the user waits before claiming, the less this matters, but users who claim frequently may miss out on small amounts of interest entirely. Over time, this adds up and can affect user satisfaction and trust.

### PoC

Paste the following test into `/edgen-staking/test/stake/LayerEdgeStakingTest.t.sol` and run with `forge test --mt testRoundingError -vv`

```solidity
function testRoundingError() public {
        uint256 SECONDS_IN_YEAR = 365 * 24 * 60 * 60; // 365 days
        uint256 PRECISIONN = 1e18;
        uint256 userBalance = 1e9; 
        uint256 apy = 1 * 1e18; // 1% APY
        uint256 duration = 1;

        // Calculate step by step
        uint256 numerator = userBalance * apy * duration;
        uint256 denominator = SECONDS_IN_YEAR * PRECISIONN;
        uint256 result1 = numerator / denominator;
        uint256 finalInterest = result1 / 100;

        emit log_named_uint("Numerator", numerator);
        emit log_named_uint("Denominator", denominator);
        emit log_named_uint("Intermediate result (before /100)", result1);
        emit log_named_uint("Final interest (wei)", finalInterest);

        assertEq(finalInterest, 0);
    }
```

### Mitigation

Use higher internal precision (e.g., multiply by `1e18` at the start and divide at the end)
