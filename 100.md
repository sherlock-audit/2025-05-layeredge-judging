# Compounding rewards fail to improve user tiers due to frozen Fenwick Tree rankings

### Summary

The protocol updates staked balances during compounding but does not adjust Fenwick Tree values, which only track user counts.
This causes stagnant tier rankings for compounding users as their increased stake isn't reflected in the tier calculation system.
Users who compound rewards to grow their stake.
The protocol's compounding function will silently ignore balance increases for tier purposes.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L213

Current Behavior:

Compounding via compoundInterest() increases user.balance but skips stakerTree.update().

The Fenwick Tree only counts users (each as +1), not their stake amounts.

Example:

UserA starts with 100 ETH → Tier 2.

Compounds to 150 ETH → Still Tier 2 (should qualify for Tier 1).

### Internal Pre-conditions

Compounding is enabled (compoundingEnabled = true).

User has earned interest (user.interestEarned > 0).

Rewards reserve has sufficient funds (rewardsReserve >= claimable).

### External Pre-conditions

Protocol advertises compounding as a way to "grow your stake and rewards".

Users expect higher balances to improve their tier status.



### Attack Path

Initial Stake:

User stakes 90 ETH → Assigned Tier 2 (30% bracket).

Earn Interest:

Earns 60 ETH interest over time (interestEarned = 60 ETH).

Compound:

Calls compoundInterest() → Balance grows to 150 ETH.

Tier Check:

Protocol still uses original join order for ranking → Remains Tier 2.

Loss: User misses Tier 1 APY (e.g., 50% vs Tier 2's 30%).

### Impact

Users lose 20-40% APY potential from unrewarded compounding.

Protocol undermines its compounding incentive mechanism.

Financial Impact: For 150 ETH stake:

Tier1 APY (50%) → 75 ETH/yr

Tier2 APY (30%) → 45 ETH/yr

30 ETH annual opportunity cost per user.

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update Fenwick Tree on Compounding:
Modify compoundInterest() to adjust tree values:
```solidity
function compoundInterest() external {
    // ... existing logic ...
    if (!user.outOfTree) {
        stakerTree.update(user.joinId, int256(claimable)); // Add compounded amount
    }
}
```

Stake-Weighted Tree:
Redesign the Fenwick Tree to track cumulative stake amounts instead of counts (see Issue #4 mitigation).
