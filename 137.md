# When compounding is disabled, stakers can still compound their interest

### Summary

The contract provides a mechanism for disabling the compoundInterest() function

However, this does not at all achieve its intended purpose, because running a transaction that runs both claimInterest() and stake() has literally the same effect as calling compoundInterest()

Therefore, when compounding is disabled, stakers can still compound their interest

### Root Cause

Let's look at compoundInterest

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L225-L234

```solidity
        rewardsReserve -= claimable;

        // Add earned interest to staked balance
        user.balance += claimable;
        totalStaked += claimable;

        // Reset interest tracking
        user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;
        user.interestEarned = 0;
        user.totalClaimed += claimable;
```

We see there are 6 state changes performed

If we look in _claimInterest and _stake, we see the same 6 state changes performed. Actually 7 state changes in total, but two of them are `user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;`, which is idempotent when a user calls both claimInterest and stake in the same transaction.

### Internal Pre-conditions

compoundingEnabled needs to be set to false

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The owner calls `setCompoundingStatus(false)`, intending that people will no longer be able to compound their interest
2. Anyone who calls claimInterest() and then stake() can still compound their interest

### Impact

For whatever reason, the owner wishes to prevent stakers from compounding their interest. Presumably there must be a reason, otherwise that flag wouldn't exist.

However, users can continue to compound their interest

Really, I consider this a low; submitting just in case.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Just remove this option. It's pretty nonsensical. You can't stop people from compounding interest while also letting them claim and stake interest.
