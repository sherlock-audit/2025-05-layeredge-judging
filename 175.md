# Approval Race Condition in WETH9 Contract

### Summary

The `approve` function’s direct allowance overwrite in the `WETH9` contract will cause unauthorized token transfers for token owners, as a malicious spender can front-run an allowance reduction to use the old allowance and then the new allowance.


### Root Cause

In the `approve` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/WETH9.sol#L37-L41), the contract directly sets `allowance[msg.sender][guy] = wad` without checking the existing allowance, allowing a spender to exploit a race condition by using the old allowance before it is updated.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A token owner needs to call `approve` to set `allowance[owner][spender]` to a non-zero value (e.g., 100 tokens).
2. The token owner needs to call `approve` again to reduce `allowance[owner][spender]` to a lower value (e.g., 50 tokens).


### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Alice (token owner) approves Bob (spender) to transfer 100 tokens by calling `approve(Bob, 100)`, setting `allowance[Alice][Bob] = 100`.
2. Alice decides to reduce Bob’s allowance and calls `approve(Bob, 50)`, with the transaction pending in the mempool.
3. Bob observes the pending `approve(Bob, 50)` transaction and quickly calls `transferFrom(Alice, Bob, 100)` to use the current allowance (100 tokens).
4. If Bob’s `transferFrom` is mined first, it transfers 100 tokens from Alice to Bob, consuming the allowance.
5. Alice’s `approve(Bob, 50)` is then mined, setting `allowance[Alice][Bob] = 50`.
6. Bob calls `transferFrom(Alice, Bob, 50)` again, transferring an additional 50 tokens using the new allowance.


### Impact

A malicious spender can transfer more tokens than the token owner intended (e.g., 150 tokens instead of 50), leading to financial loss for the token owner.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use OpenZeppelin’s ERC20 safe allowance functions like `increaseAllowance` and `decreaseAllowance` to modify the approvals.
