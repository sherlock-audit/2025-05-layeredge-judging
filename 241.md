# Incorrect Handling of Min Stake Check on Second and Later Deposits

### Summary

The staking contract does not validate that subsequent deposits meet the minimum stake amount requirement. This flaw allows users to bypass tier constraints after an initial qualifying deposit, potentially manipulating the tiered staking system.



### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol?#L692
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol?#L700
The minStakeAmount check is only performed during the first deposit (!user.isActive). Subsequent deposits do not verify whether the amount staked meets the required minimum.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract logic allows tier calculations to depend solely on the initial deposit meeting the minStakeAmount requirement.
2. No validation exists for subsequent deposits to comply with the minimum stake rule.



### External Pre-conditions

1. A user stakes an amount equal to or greater than the minStakeAmount to activate their account and qualify for a higher tier.
2. The same user deposits a smaller amount in subsequent transactions.





### Attack Path

1. The attacker makes an initial deposit exceeding the minStakeAmount to gain access to a higher tier.
2. The attacker makes multiple small deposits, which bypass the minimum stake requirement.
3. The attacker retains their tier status despite the total subsequent deposits not meeting the intended constraints.



### Impact

This vulnerability undermines the integrity of the tiered staking system:

Users can manipulate the staking mechanism to achieve higher rewards unjustly.

Legitimate stakers are unfairly disadvantaged, leading to reduced trust in the contract.



### PoC

Deploy the contract and set the minStakeAmount to 3000 tokens.

User A deposits 3000 tokens in their first transaction, qualifying for Tier 1.

User A deposits 100 tokens in subsequent transactions.

Observe that User A retains their Tier 1 status despite additional deposits not meeting the minStakeAmount.

### Mitigation

1. Add a validation step to enforce the minStakeAmount for all deposits, not just the first:

```solidity
require(amount >= minStakeAmount, "Stake amount is below the minimum requirement");
```
2. Alternatively, enforce the tier calculation based on the aggregate staked balance:
 
```solidity
if (user.balance + amount < minStakeAmount) {
    // Adjust tier to Tier 3
}
```
3. Test extensively to ensure the updated logic does not inadvertently impact the staking system's functionality.
