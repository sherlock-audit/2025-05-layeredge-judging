# Interest Claiming in Native Tokens Leading to Protocol Loss

### Summary
The `LayerEdgeStaking` contract allows users to claim accrued interest in native tokens, even if the interest was earned on ERC20 staking tokens. This creates an arbitrage opportunity where users can exploit the price difference between the ERC20 staking token and the native token, potentially leading to a financial loss for the protocol.

### Vulnerability Details
- **Root Cause**: `user.interestEarned` is tracked, not considering erc20 token or native token
- **Components Affected**: `claimInterestNative`, `compoundInterest`, `_updateInterest`
- **Impact**: Users can claim interest in native tokens, which are often valued higher than the ERC20 staking tokens, resulting in a financial loss for the protocol.

### Exploit Scenario
1. **Staking and Interest Accrual**:
   - A user stakes ERC20 tokens and accrues interest over time through the `compoundInterest` and `_updateInterest` functions.

2. **Claiming Interest in Native Tokens**:
   - The user calls the [claimInterestNative](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L206) function to claim their accrued interest in native tokens.
   - The protocol converts the ERC20 interest amount to native tokens without considering the price difference, leading to a potential loss.

3. **Profit Realization**:
   - The user receives native tokens, which are often valued higher than the equivalent ERC20 tokens.
   - The protocol incurs a loss as it effectively pays out more value than it received.

### Steps to Exploit
1. **Stake ERC20 Tokens**:
   ```Solidity
   function stake(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
       _stake(amount, msg.sender, false);
   }
   ```

2. **Accrue Interest**:
   - Allow interest to accrue over time through `compoundInterest` and `_updateInterest`.

3. **Claim Interest in Native Tokens**:
   ```Solidity
   function claimInterestNative() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
       _claimInterest(msg.sender, true);
   }


    function _claimInterest(address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
        _updateInterest(userAddr);

        UserInfo storage user = users[userAddr];
        uint256 claimable = user.interestEarned; ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ

        require(claimable > 0, "Nothing to claim");

        // Check if we have enough rewards in the contract
        require(rewardsReserve >= claimable, "Insufficient rewards in contract");

        user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;
        user.interestEarned = 0;
        user.totalClaimed += claimable;

        // Update rewards reserve
        rewardsReserve -= claimable;

        // Transfer tokens to user
        if (!isNative) {
            require(stakingToken.transfer(userAddr, claimable), "Token transfer failed");
        } else {
            IWETH(address(stakingToken)).withdraw(claimable);
            (bool success,) = payable(userAddr).call{value: claimable}(""); ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ
            require(success, "Claim interest native transfer failed");
        }

        emit RewardClaimed(userAddr, claimable);
    }
   ```

4. **Receive Higher Value**:
   - The user receives native tokens, potentially valued higher than the ERC20 tokens.

### User can also do the opposite
If the native token price is lower than the stake token price. He will stake in native, and when the time comes to claim interest, he will claim interest in ERC20 tokens. Or whenever he sees an opportunity, no matter what direction he stakes, he will claim interest in the direction that gives him profits.
Because his final goal is to make a profit for himself and a loss for the protocol.

But now we can see the price of ETH is really higher.

### Recommendations
- **Separate Interest Tracking**: Implement separate tracking for interest earned in ERC20 tokens and native tokens to prevent cross-token claims.
- **Price Oracle Integration**: Use a price oracle to determine the equivalent value of native tokens when users claim interest, ensuring accurate payouts.
- **Protocol Controls**: Introduce controls to limit the amount of native tokens that can be claimed relative to the interest earned in ERC20 tokens.

By addressing these issues, the protocol can prevent users from exploiting the price differences between token types and protect its financial integrity.
