# Users Can Illegitimately Accrue and Claim Interest for Zero-Time Periods During Unstake Due to Incorrect Timestamp Handling in LayerEdgeStaking

### Summary

A critical bug in the LayerEdgeStaking contract allows users to accrue and claim nonzero interest even when no time has elapsed between staking and unstaking actions. This occurs due to an incorrect order of operations in the `_unstake` function, enabling users to repeatedly extract rewards from the protocol for zero time, leading to potential protocol insolvency.


### Root Cause

The bug is caused by the order in which `_updateInterest` and `user.lastClaimTime` are called in the `_unstake` function. Specifically, `_updateInterest` is called **before** `user.lastClaimTime` is updated to `block.timestamp`. As a result, the interest calculation uses the previous `lastClaimTime` and the current `block.timestamp`, and then immediately sets `lastClaimTime` to the same value. This allows the user to accrue and store interest for a period of zero seconds, which should not be possible.

```javascript
function _unstake(uint256 amount, address userAddr) internal {
    UserInfo storage user = users[userAddr];
    require(user.balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    _updateInterest(userAddr); // <-- Called before updating lastClaimTime
    user.balance -= amount;
    user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp; // <-- Updated after interest calculation
    // ...
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The staking contract must have a nonzero rewards reserve.
2. The user must have staked tokens and have a positive balance.
3. The user must be able to call unstake (i.e., after the minimum staking period, if any).

### External Pre-conditions

1. The attacker must have access to sufficient tokens to stake.
2. The attacker must be able to interact with the contract in rapid succession (e.g., within the same block or with minimal time elapsed).
3. Network conditions allow for quick transaction mining.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker stakes tokens and waits for the minimum unstake window (if any).
2. Attacker calls unstake for a small amount. The contract calls _updateInterest before updating lastClaimTime, causing interest to be calculated for a zero-time period.
3. Attacker immediately claims interest (or compounds), receiving rewards for zero time elapsed.
4. Attacker repeats the process (stake, unstake, claim) as many times as desired, draining the rewards reserve.
5. Amplification: The attacker can use flash loans or multiple accounts to maximize extraction in a short period.

### Impact

1. Direct financial loss: The attacker can drain the entire rewards reserve by repeatedly exploiting the bug.
2. Protocol insolvency: Legitimate stakers will be unable to claim their rightful rewards.


### PoC

```javascript
function test_CriticalZeroTimeInterestBug_POC() public {
    // Setup: Create a user and give them tokens
    address testUser = makeAddr("testUser");
    uint256 stakeAmount = 47_000 * 1e18;

    // Fund the user and rewards
    deal(address(token), testUser, stakeAmount * 2);
    vm.startPrank(admin);
    uint256 rewardAmount = 1_000_000 * 1e18;
    deal(address(token), admin, rewardAmount);
    token.approve(address(staking), rewardAmount);
    staking.depositRewards(rewardAmount);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Step 1: User stakes
    vm.startPrank(testUser);
    token.approve(address(staking), stakeAmount);
    staking.stake(stakeAmount);

    // Step 2: Advance time to allow unstake
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 7 days + 1);

    // Step 3: User unstakes a small amount
    staking.unstake(1);

    // Step 4: Immediately check interest 
    uint256 calculatedInterest = staking.calculateUnclaimedInterest(testUser);
    (, uint256 lastClaimTime,,,,,,,) = staking.users(testUser);

    emit log_named_uint("Last claim time", lastClaimTime);
    emit log_named_uint("Current time", block.timestamp);
    emit log_named_uint("Calculated interest", calculatedInterest);

    
    assertEq(calculatedInterest, 0, "Interest should be zero immediately after unstake if no time has elapsed");
    vm.stopPrank();
}

```



### Mitigation

Change the order of operations in _unstake so that user.lastClaimTime is updated before calling _updateInterest. This ensures that interest is never calculated for a zero-time period.

```javascript
function _unstake(uint256 amount, address userAddr) internal {
    UserInfo storage user = users[userAddr];
    require(user.balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp; // Set timestamp first
    _updateInterest(userAddr);             // Then update interest
    user.balance -= amount;
    // ... rest of function unchanged
}
```
