# Malicious Users can exploit the Unlimited Compounding in LayerEdgeStaking contract to Drain Rewards Disproportionately

### Summary

The lack of restrictions on `compoundInterest` call frequency in the `LayerEdgeStaking` contract will cause significant reward inequity for honest stakers as malicious users will repeatedly call `compoundInterest` every time to maximize interest earnings, unfairly depleting the `rewardsReserve`.



### Root Cause

In `LayerEdgeStaking.sol`, the `compoundInterest` function lacks any limit on call frequency or a minimum interest threshold, allowing malicious users to compound interest excessively (e.g., with minutes or  hourly). This results in near-continuous compounding, yielding higher rewards compared to honest stakers disproportionately draining the rewardsReserve.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L213C3-L241C6

The `compoundInterest` function calculates and adds accrued interest to a user’s balance, resetting the interest tracking without restrictions on how often it can be called
```solidity
function compoundInterest() external whenCompoundingEnabled nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    _updateInterest(msg.sender); // Calculates interestEarned
    UserInfo storage user = users[msg.sender];
    uint256 claimable = user.interestEarned;
    require(claimable > 0, "Nothing to compound");
    require(rewardsReserve >= claimable, "Insufficient rewards in contract");
    rewardsReserve -= claimable; // Deduct from reward pool
    user.balance += claimable; // Add interest to principal
    totalStaked += claimable;
    user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp; // Reset interest accrual
    user.interestEarned = 0;
    user.totalClaimed += claimable;
    Tier tier = getCurrentTier(msg.sender);
    emit RewardClaimed(msg.sender, claimable);
    emit Staked(msg.sender, claimable, tier);
}
```
The function has no cooldown period or minimum claimable threshold, allowing calls as often as every block (~12 seconds) as long as `interestEarned > 0`. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

Admin needs to call `setCompoundingEnabled()` to set `compoundingEnabled` to be true.

`rewardsReserve` needs to be at least sufficient to cover compounded interest.

`stakerTierHistory` for the malicious user needs to reflect Tier 1 (50% APY) to maximize interest gains.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

Malicious user calls stake to deposit a large balance in Tier 1 (50% APY) to maximize interest accrual.

Malicious user calls `compoundInterest()` hourly using an automated script, compounding accrued interest to increase their balance for the next period.

Malicious user repeats `compoundInterest()` calls each time adding interestEarned to balance and deducting from rewardsReserve.

### Impact

1. Honest stakers suffer an approximate loss of reward share, as malicious users gain more interest 

2. The protocol’s `rewardsReserve` is depleted significantly faster 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Require `claimable` to exceed a minimum amount or Implement a cooldown to limit `compoundInterest` frequency
