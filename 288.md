# Breaking of the invariant leads to loss for some of the stakers in the system

### Summary

The invariant that the protocol wants to hold - 
What properties/invariants do you want to hold even if breaking them has a low/unknown impact?
Tier distribution correctness: Exactly 20% in Tier 1, 30% in Tier 2, and 50% in Tier 3 (with minimum guarantees of at least 1 user per tier when applicable) is being broken and due to this invariant some of the users(stakers) will always face a loss due to them being pushed out of a tier that they should have been a part of this violates its core tier distribution invariant due to integer division rounding, causing systematic unfair treatment of stakers and financial losses for users who should be in higher tiers

### Root Cause

Expected Invariant: Exactly 20% in Tier 1, 30% in Tier 2, and 50% in Tier 3 (in the contest readme)
Current Implementation: Uses integer division with truncation, breaking the invariant.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Contract uses integer division with truncation in getTierCountForStakerCount() (which is does) https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L486

### External Pre-conditions

Numerical Examples Demonstrating the Issue
Example 1: 99 Total Stakers
Expected Distribution (20%, 30%, 50%):

Actual Implementation:
tier1Count = (99 * 20) / 100 = 1980 / 100 = 19(round down)  // Should be 20
tier2Count = (99 * 30) / 100 = 2970 / 100 = 29 (round down) // Should be 30
tier3Count = 99 - 19 - 29 = 51                   // Should be 49
Result: 19/29/51 instead of 20/30/49
Tier 3 gets 51.5% instead of 49.5%
User at Rank 20: Should be Tier 1 (50% APY), gets Tier 2 (35% APY) - loses 1,500 tokens/year
User at Rank 49: Should be Tier 2 (35% APY), gets Tier 3 (20% APY) - loses 1,500 tokens/year
Impact: 2 users who should be in higher tiers are stuck in Tier 3


Example 3: 83 Total Stakers 
Expected Distribution:



Actual Implementation:
tier1Count = (83 * 20) / 100 = 1660 / 100 = 16 (round down) // Should be 17
tier2Count = (83 * 30) / 100 = 2490 / 100 = 24 (round down) // Should be 25
tier3Count = 83 - 16 - 24 = 43                   // Should be 41
Result: 16/24/43 instead of 17/25/41
User at Rank 17: Should be Tier 1 (50% APY), gets Tier 2 (35% APY) - loses 1,500 tokens/year
User at Rank 25: Should be Tier 2 (35% APY), gets Tier 3 (20% APY) - loses 1,500 tokens/year
this is just a small example this can happen with various ranks leading to this invariant always being broken

### Impact

Users that should gain more apy are pushed to lower tiers due to rounding 
core invariant broken

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

round up instead of rounding down
