# Improper Update of `lastClaimTime` in `_stake` function

**Description:**

In the `_stake` function, the `user.lastClaimTime` is updated to `block.timestamp` immediately after a `user` stakes tokens. This update occurs regardless of whether the user has claimed any rewards. The `lastClaimTime` is intended to track the last time a user claimed or updated their interest, not when they staked tokens.

**Impact:** 

This could lead to inaccurate reward distributions, either overcompensating or undercompensating users.

**Proof of Concept:**

1. A `user` stakes tokens, triggering the _stake function.
2. The `user.lastClaimTime` is set to the current `block.timestamp.`
3. When the `user` later claims interest, the system calculates interest based on the updated lastClaimTime, potentially resulting in incorrect reward amounts.

**Recommended Mitigation:**

Just delete the update.

```diff
function _stake(uint256 amount, address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {

    // REST OF CODE

-      user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;
}

```
