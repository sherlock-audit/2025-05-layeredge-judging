# [M-03] Early Stakers Lose Tier Benefits Due to Flawed Reward Distribution Logic

### Summary

The tier-based reward system in LayerEdgeStaking.sol unfairly penalizes early stakers by:
1. Permanently demoting users to Tier3 if they unstake below minStakeAmount
2. Failing to properly recalculate tiers for all affected users during stake/unstake
3. Not accounting for time-based loyalty in reward distribution

### Root Cause

1. Permanent Tier Locking:
In [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L740-L749](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L740-L749)
- The outOfTree flag is irreversible—once set, users cannot regain higher tiers.
- This disproportionately affects early stakers who may need to partially unstake.

2. Incomplete Tier Recalculation:
In [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L841-L865](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L841-L865)
- _checkBoundariesAndRecord() only updates boundary stakers, missing intermediate users who should change tiers.

3. Pure Rank-Based System:
- Rewards do not consider staking duration, disadvantaging long-term participants.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user must have staked at least minStakeAmount.
2. The user’s balance later falls below minStakeAmount (e.g., via partial unstaking).
3. The protocol has active stakers near tier boundaries (Tier1/Tier2 thresholds).

### External Pre-conditions

1. The staking pool has been active long enough for users to unstake partially.
2. APY differences between tiers are significant (Tier1 > Tier2 > Tier3).

### Attack Path

**Scenario: Early Staker Loses Tier1 Status**
1. Alice stakes 5000 tokens (early, gets Tier1).
2. Bob stakes later, pushing Alice to Tier1 boundary.
3. Alice unstakes 2000 tokens (balance = 3000, below minStakeAmount).
- She is marked outOfTree = true and permanently set to Tier3.
4. Alice re-stakes 2000 tokens (balance = 5000).
- Bug: She remains in Tier3 despite having sufficient stake.

### Impact

1. Loss of rewards: Alice’s APY drops from 50% (Tier1) to 20% (Tier3).
2. Protocol unfairness: Early stakers are not rewarded for loyalty.
3. Reduced participation: Users avoid unstaking to preserve tiers.

### PoC

```solidity
// Test case: Early staker unfairly demoted
function testEarlyStakerTierLoss() public {
    // Alice stakes 5000 (Tier1)
    vm.prank(alice);
    staking.stake(5000 ether);
    assertEq(uint(staking.getCurrentTier(alice)), uint(Tier.Tier1));

    // Bob stakes, pushing Alice to Tier1 boundary
    vm.prank(bob);
    staking.stake(5000 ether);

    // Alice unstakes partially (now below minStakeAmount)
    vm.prank(alice);
    staking.unstake(2000 ether);
    assertEq(uint(staking.getCurrentTier(alice)), uint(Tier.Tier3)); // Wrong! Should be recalculated

    // Alice re-stakes, but remains Tier3
    vm.prank(alice);
    staking.stake(2000 ether);
    assertEq(uint(staking.getCurrentTier(alice)), uint(Tier.Tier3)); // Still wrong!
}
```

### Mitigation

**1. Remove Permanent Tier Demotion**
```solidity
// In _unstake(): Remove outOfTree flag
if (!user.outOfTree && user.balance < minStakeAmount) {
    stakerTree.update(user.joinId, -1);
    stakerCountInTree--;
    _checkBoundariesAndRecord(true); // Recalculate tiers
}
```
**2. Full Tier Recalculation**
```solidity
function _checkBoundariesAndRecord(bool isRemoval) internal {
    uint256 n = stakerCountInTree;
    for (uint256 rank = 1; rank <= n; rank++) {
        uint256 joinId = stakerTree.findByCumulativeFrequency(rank);
        address user = stakerAddress[joinId];
        Tier newTier = _computeTierByRank(rank, n);
        _recordTierChange(user, newTier); // Update all affected users
    }
}
```
**3. Add Time-Based Rewards**
```solidity
// In getUserAPY():
if (block.timestamp - user.initialStakeTime <= 30 days) {
    baseAPY += (baseAPY * 10) / 100; // +10% APY for early stakers
}
```
