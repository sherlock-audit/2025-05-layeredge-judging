# Changing `setMinStakeAmount` will make some staker be ineligle to be in the tree, but they will still be there

### Summary

All users who have bellow the new min will still be included in the tree and will earn higher rewards than users who are above the min, but added to the back of the tree.

### Root Cause

After a staker gets added to the tree, the only way for him go be removed is for `unstake` to trigger this this `if`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L740
```solidity
        if (!user.outOfTree && user.balance < minStakeAmount) {
            // execute this before removing from tree, this will make sure to calculate interest
            // for amount left after unstake
            _recordTierChange(userAddr, Tier.Tier3);
            stakerTree.update(user.joinId, -1);
            stakerCountInTree--;
            user.outOfTree = true;
            stakerCountOutOfTree++;
            _checkBoundariesAndRecord(true);
        }
```

The issue here is that some users might stake the min required to be in the tree (3000e18 currently) and if that amount increases in the future they will still be a part of the tree and will earn higher rewards even though they are bellow the min.

```solidity
    function setMinStakeAmount(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        minStakeAmount = amount;
    }
```


There are no checks inside `_updateInterest`, meaning the user can call stake with 1 wei and update his interest or he can just claim his interest whenever he chooses to `claimInterest`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Alice stakes 3000e18 and gets added to T1
2. After some time the owner decides to increase the min to 5000e18
3. Alice and all of the rest of the user will continue earning T1 rewards based off a stake that is bellow the min

Now take into account that it won't happen to only 1 user, but to all who have above the old min and bellow the new min.

### Impact

In such case all users who have bellow the new min will still be included in the tree and will earn higher rewards than users who are above the min, but added to the back of the tree.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider checking user balance in `_updateInterest` and adjust his rank if he is bellow the min.
