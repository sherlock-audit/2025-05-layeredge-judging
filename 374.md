# Precision Loss in Interest Calculation

## Summary
`LayerEdgeStaking::calculateUnclaimedInterest` function suffers from precision loss due to sequential integer divisions, causing users to lose earned interest especially for small balances or short staking periods.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L443-L448

## Description
The interest calculation performs two sequential integer divisions which truncate remainders at each step:

```solidity
uint256 periodInterest = ((user.balance * apy * (periodEnd - periodStart)) / (SECONDS_IN_YEAR * PRECISION)) / 100;
```

This breaks the security guarantee that users receive accurate interest calculations proportional to their stake and time. The precision loss occurs because:
1. First division by `(SECONDS_IN_YEAR * PRECISION)` truncates fractional results
2. Second division by `100` further truncates the already-reduced value
3. The large divisor `SECONDS_IN_YEAR` (31,536,000) makes small time periods or balances vulnerable to significant truncation

## Impact
This is a **Medium** severity issue because it directly affects user funds through systematic underpayment of earned interest. With APY rates ranging from 20-50% in this first-come-first-serve system, the precision loss becomes more significant due to higher expected returns. The protocol essentially "keeps" the truncated interest that should belong to users, which is particularly problematic for early stakers expecting premium rates.

## Likelihood Explanation
This issue has **High** likelihood as it occurs on every interest calculation. In this first-come-first-serve staking system with premium APY rates (50% for Tier 1, 35% for Tier 2, 20% for Tier 3), the impact is amplified because:
- Early stakers expect higher returns but lose more absolute value to truncation
- Users with small balances still get 0 interest despite high APY rates
- Higher APY calculations make the precision loss more noticeable
- The tiered system creates unfair advantage erosion where early adopters lose their earned premium


## Proof of Concept
**Example 1 - Small Balance (First Staker):**
- User stakes 1 token for 1 day with 50% APY (Tier 1)
- Expected interest: ~0.00137 tokens
- After truncation: 0 tokens (complete loss)

**Example 2 - Short Period (Early Staker):**
- User with 100 tokens claims after 1 hour with 35% APY (Tier 2)
- Expected interest: ~0.399 tokens
- After truncation: significant reduction due to double division

**Example 3 - Regular Staker:**
- User with 1000 tokens for 1 day with 20% APY (Tier 3)
- Expected interest: ~0.548 tokens
- After truncation: loses fractional portion

**Example 3 - Cumulative Loss:**
- User making weekly claims loses more total interest than monthly claims due to repeated truncation

How to run PoC

- Save this in `LayerEdgeStaking.t.sol`

```sol
function testPrecisionLossInInterestCalculation() public {
        uint256 SECONDS_IN_YEAR = 365 * 24 * 60 * 60; // 365 days
        uint256 PRECISION = 1e18;
        uint256 userBalance = 1e9; 
        uint256 apy = 2 * 1e18; // 2% APY
        uint256 duration = 2;

        // Calculate step by step
        uint256 numerator = userBalance * apy * duration;
        uint256 denominator = SECONDS_IN_YEAR * PRECISION;
        uint256 result1 = numerator / denominator;
        uint256 finalInterest = result1 / 100;

        emit log_named_uint("Numerator", numerator);
        emit log_named_uint("Denominator", denominator);
        emit log_named_uint("Intermediate result (before /100)", result1);
        emit log_named_uint("Final interest in wei", finalInterest);

 
    }
```


## Recommendation
Combine the divisions into a single operation to minimize precision loss:

```diff
- uint256 periodInterest = ((user.balance * apy * (periodEnd - periodStart)) / (SECONDS_IN_YEAR * PRECISION)) / 100;
+ uint256 periodInterest = (user.balance * apy * (periodEnd - periodStart)) / (SECONDS_IN_YEAR * PRECISION * 100);
```
