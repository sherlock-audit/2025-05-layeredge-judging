# Operations using native token would not work in Ethereum Mainnet

### Summary

Inside the README we can confirm that in the Ethereum Mainnet, the token used to stake would be EDGEN.
Core function also can receive native token (ETH) and it would be handled for the conversion mechanism inside the contract.
But the current implementation lacks the address of WETH and instead it use EDGEN address which is the ERC20 token.

### Root Cause

the cause is the contract assume that the staking token address is same as the native token wrapper address.
this assumption only true in the LayerEdge chain, but in Ethereum Mainnet this is different as the staking token is EDGEN and the wrapped native is WETH.

there are multiple instance of this wrong implementation:
[`_stake`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L682-L687)
```Solidity
        if (!isNative) {
            require(stakingToken.transferFrom(userAddr, address(this), amount), "Token transfer failed");
        } else {
            IWETH(address(stakingToken)).deposit{value: amount}();
        }
```

[`_completeUnstake`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L767-L774)
```solidity
        // Transfer tokens back to user
        if (!isNative) {
            require(stakingToken.transfer(userAddr, amount), "Token transfer failed");
        } else {
            IWETH(address(stakingToken)).withdraw(amount);
            (bool success,) = payable(userAddr).call{value: amount}("");
            require(success, "Unstake native transfer failed");
        }
```

[`_claimInterest`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L797-L804)
```solidity
        // Transfer tokens to user
        if (!isNative) {
            require(stakingToken.transfer(userAddr, claimable), "Token transfer failed");
        } else {
            IWETH(address(stakingToken)).withdraw(claimable);
            (bool success,) = payable(userAddr).call{value: claimable}("");
            require(success, "Claim interest native transfer failed");
        }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. contract deployed on mainnet

### External Pre-conditions

1. the parameter are set normally

### Attack Path

1. victim try to call `stakeNative` and it would revert 

### Impact

the protocol contract can not handle native token operation in Ethereum Mainnet, effectively broke the protocol core function

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

separate contract for ethereum mainnet that also handle the native token ETH being used inside the contract.
or implement new logic for current contract for handling the ETH in mainnet.
