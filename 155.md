# Use of `transfer()` instead of `call()` can cause specific transactions to revert.

### Summary

In the `WETH9.sol` contract when withdrawing ether, the `withdraw()` function uses `transfer()` instead of `call()` .The main problem is that the `transfer()` method  forwards fixed amount of 2300 gas, which may not be enough if the recipient is a smart contract that needs additional logic that requires more gas to operate which can cause the transaction to revert.

### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/WETH9.sol#L29

```solidity
    function withdraw(uint256 wad) public {
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= wad);
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= wad;
@>        payable(msg.sender).transfer(wad);
        emit Withdrawal(msg.sender, wad);
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.user,which is a smart contract  needs to deposits ether to the `WETH9.sol` contract.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The withdrawer, which is a smart contract that includes additional logic implemented in it which consumes more gas than the fixed amount of 2300 gas should withdraw from the `withdraw()` function.

### Attack Path

nil

### Impact

The impact is high because,

1.This can lead to temporary freezing of funds or in the worst case scenario even permanent freezing of funds because, The contract doesn't have any recovery mechanism in the above mentioned case to transfer the locked ether back the  user(smart contract). The `Withdraw()` function is depended upon the `msg.sender` when withdrawing eth so this makes the eth deposited by the smart contract to get stuck in the contract.

2.Smart contract wallets are very popular in the defi space. This could affect their interactions with the protocol.


### PoC

consider a scenario where a smart contract is interacting with the WETH9.sol contract

1. it deposits some ether, lets say 10 ether in to the contract.
2. The contract then tries to withdraw  the ether using the `withdraw()` function.
3. The  contract has additional logic implemented in it when receiving ether to it which costs more than the fixed gas (which is 2300 gas) that is forwarded from the  WETH9 contract because of the method `transfer()` .
4. The ether gets stuck in the contract.

### Mitigation

use `call()` instead of transfer. Modify the `withdraw()` function 
```diff
 function withdraw(uint256 wad) public {
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= wad);
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= wad;
-        payable(msg.sender).transfer(wad);
+        (bool success,) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: wad}("");
+        require(success, "transfer failed");
        emit Withdrawal(msg.sender, wad);
    }
```
