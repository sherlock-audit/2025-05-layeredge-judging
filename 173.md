# Bypassing MAX_USERS Cap Causes Incorrect Tier Assignments and Reward Overpayments in LayerEdgeStaking

### Summary

The absence of a check for `nextJoinId <= MAX_USERS` in the `_stake` function causes incorrect tier assignments for users staking when `nextJoinId > MAX_USERS`, as the contract assigns an invalid `joinId` that does not update the Fenwick Tree, yet increments `stakerCountInTree`. This inflates tier calculations in `_computeTierByRank`, allowing users beyond `MAX_USERS` to receive higher tiers (e.g., `Tier.Tier2`) and earn higher APY (e.g., 35% instead of 20%).


### Root Cause

In the `_stake` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L700-L713), the contract does not verify if `nextJoinId <= MAX_USERS` before assigning `user.joinId = nextJoinId++` and calling `stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1)`. The Fenwick Tree’s `update` function skips updates for `index > self.size`  leading to an ineffective `joinId` assignment. However, `stakerCountInTree` is incremented, causing `_computeTierByRank` to miscalculate tiers based on an inflated staker count.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract owner initializes the contract to set `MAX_USERS` to any value on deployment.
2. A new user stakes at least `minStakeAmount` to trigger `nextJoinId++` when  `MAX_USERS` has been reached.


### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. The contract is initialized with `MAX_USERS = 100_000_000` (as in the contract) or 100 (as in the test), setting `stakerTree.size = MAX_USERS`.
2. `MAX_USERS` users stake at least `minStakeAmount`, setting `nextJoinId = MAX_USERS + 1` and `stakerCountInTree = MAX_USERS`.
3. A new user stakes 3000 * 1e18 tokens (>= `minStakeAmount`).
4. `_stake` assigns `user.joinId = nextJoinId++` and calls `stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1)`.
5. The Fenwick Tree’s `update` skips because `user.joinId > stakerTree.size`.
6. `stakerCountInTree` increments.
7. `_computeTierByRank(0, stakerCountInTree)` uses the inflated `stakerCountInTree` (e.g., 300 in test).
8. Some users are assigned a higher tier (e.g., `Tier.Tier2` from `Tier.Tier3`) due to the inflated `stakerCountInTree`, earning 35% APY instead of the intended 20% for `Tier.Tier3`.


### Impact

Users staking when `nextJoinId > MAX_USERS` are assigned ineffective `joinId`s, not tracked in the Fenwick Tree, and should receive `Tier.Tier3` (20% APY). However, due to the inflated `stakerCountInTree`, `_computeTierByRank` assigns higher tiers (e.g., `Tier.Tier2`, 35% APY), causing users to earn higher rewards than intended. This results in unintended reward payouts and misleads users about their tier status.


### PoC

The following test demonstrates the bug by showing that user 65, who should be in `Tier.Tier3` in a 100-user capped contract, is incorrectly assigned `Tier.Tier2` and earns 35% APY due to the inflated `stakerCountInTree`.

Note: Due to `MAX_USERS = 100_000_000` consuming too much memory in Foundry (causing `EvmError: MemoryLimitOOG`), the `MAX_USERS` constant in `LayerEdgeStaking.sol` was reduced to `100` to demonstrate the impact.

```solidity
function test_max_user_cap_is_exceeded() public {
    uint256[] memory initialBalances = new uint256[](300);
    address[] memory boys = new address[](300);
    uint256 userAmount = 100_000 * 1e18; // 100k tokens per test user

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < boys.length; i++) {
        boys[i] = makeAddr(string(abi.encodePacked("user", vm.toString(i))));
        vm.startPrank(admin);
        token.transfer(boys[i], userAmount);
        vm.stopPrank();
        initialBalances[i] = token.balanceOf(boys[i]);
    }

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < boys.length; i++) {
        vm.startPrank(boys[i]);
        token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE);
        staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < boys.length; i++) {
        assertEq(token.balanceOf(boys[i]), initialBalances[i] - MIN_STAKE);
    }

    (uint256 tier1Count, uint256 tier2Count, uint256 tier3Count) = staking.getTierCounts();
    assertEq(tier1Count, 60); // 20% of 300 = 60
    assertEq(tier2Count, 90); // 30% of 300 = 90
    assertEq(tier3Count, 150); // 50% of 300 = 150

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 365 days);

    // Check accrued interest
    (,,, uint256 pendingRewards) = staking.getUserInfo(makeAddr(string(abi.encodePacked("user", "65"))));

    // Calculate expected rewards for 30 days at tier 2 (35%)
    uint256 expectedRewards = (MIN_STAKE * 35 * PRECISION * 365 days) / (365 days * PRECISION) / 100;

    assertApproxEqAbs(pendingRewards, expectedRewards, 2);
}
```

This test shows that the contract fails to enforce the `MAX_USERS` cap (originally 100 million, tested with 100), allowing `stakerCountInTree` to inflate beyond the Fenwick Tree’s capacity. If the 100 million user cap is exceeded, users within the first 100 million could be incorrectly assigned higher tiers (e.g., `Tier.Tier2`, 35% APY) instead of `Tier.Tier3` (20% APY), leading to excessive reward payouts for users beyond the intended cap.



### Mitigation

Add a check in `_stake` before `user.joinId = nextJoinId++`:
```solidity
require(nextJoinId <= MAX_USERS, "Max users reached");
```
