# Duplicate Timestamps in Tier Events Cause Skipped APY Periods

### Summary

The calculateUnclaimedInterest function assumes that each TierEvent is associated with a unique timestamp that marks the beginning of a new tier period. However, under certain conditions, it is possible to record multiple TierEvent entries with the same timestamp, leading to silent skipping of interest periods during APY calculation. This may result in loss of earned interest for users, particularly when they transition through multiple tiers in a short span of time.



### Root Cause

The function calculateUnclaimedInterest relies on periodEnd > periodStart to calculate interest per tier. When two tier transitions share the same timestamp, the delta becomes zero, and the calculation is skipped.

### Internal Pre-conditions

user.lastClaimTime is set and staker has a non-zero balance

stakerTierHistory[user] already contains at least one tier event

A function such as stake() or claim() calls _updateTier(user) multiple times within the same block

### External Pre-conditions

The Ethereum block timestamp remains unchanged between multiple calls to _updateTier() within the same block

The user submits multiple transactions via multicall, a high-frequency bot, or through manual RPC batching

### Attack Path

User calls stake() which internally calls _updateTier(user) and adds a new TierEvent at block.timestamp

In the same block, user calls claim() which also calls _updateTier(user)

Both calls result in two TierEvents with identical timestamps but different Tier values

Later, when calculateUnclaimedInterest(user) is called, it detects two events with the same timestamp

The logic sets periodStart = periodEnd and skips interest calculation for the period, silently losing earned interest

### Impact

Users lose interest they should have earned

Incorrect APY attribution (especially if tier jumping was strategic)

Exploitable vector: An attacker could manipulate tier transitions to burn APY periods (e.g., toggling Tier2â€“Tier3 in same block)

Difficult to debug or notice due to silent nature of continue



### PoC

Suppose we have the following tier update pattern:

function stake(uint256 amount) external {
    _updateTier(msg.sender);
    _stake(msg.sender, amount);
}

function claim() external {
    _updateTier(msg.sender);
    _claimRewards(msg.sender);
}
Both stake() and claim() internally call _updateTier(), and may be invoked within the same block either:

Through a multicall,

By a high-frequency bot,

Or even manually via a fast sequencer (e.g., rollups, L2s).

This can lead to:

stakerTierHistory[user] = [
    TierEvent(timestamp = 1716400000, to = Tier2),
    TierEvent(timestamp = 1716400000, to = Tier3) // same block!
];
Now, in calculateUnclaimedInterest(), when computing APY per period:

periodStart = userTierHistory[i].timestamp;
periodEnd = userTierHistory[i+1].timestamp;
if (periodEnd <= periodStart) continue; // silently skipped
The second tier period is ignored because periodEnd == periodStart.

ðŸ›‘ Effect: The user was briefly in Tier2 during this block and potentially eligible for a high APY, but this interest is never calculated or added. If Tier2 was a high-reward tier (e.g., temporary bonus), that reward is lost permanently.



### Mitigation

Prevent tier history from recording entries with duplicate timestamps:

function _updateTier(address user) internal {
    if (
        stakerTierHistory[user].length == 0 ||
        stakerTierHistory[user][stakerTierHistory[user].length - 1].timestamp < block.timestamp
    ) {
        stakerTierHistory[user].push(TierEvent(block.timestamp, _calculateNewTier(user)));
    } else {
        stakerTierHistory[user][stakerTierHistory[user].length - 1].to = _calculateNewTier(user);
    }
}
This merges same-block tier updates into one entry.
