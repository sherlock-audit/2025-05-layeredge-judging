# Insufficient Rewards Validation After Interest Accrual could lead to a situation a user not being able to claim interest

### Summary

In `LayerEdgeStaking.sol::_claimInterest()` the contract validates reward sufficiency after calculating additional accrued interest. If an admin withdraws rewards leaving just enough for a user's pre-update balance, the subsequent interest update during claim could push the required amount above available reserves, causing the claim to unexpectedly fail.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this vulnerability is an improper ordering of operations in the _claimInterest function. The contract first calls _updateInterest(userAddr), which calculates and updates the latest accrued interest for the user, before checking if there are sufficient rewards available in the contract to fulfill the claim.

This violates the secure coding principle of "check-effects-interactions" where validations should occur before state changes. Because the interest update can increase the amount a user is entitled to claim, performing this update before checking available reserves creates a situation where the check might fail even though it would have passed based on the pre-update value.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L779-L807

The specific issue in the code flow is:

```solidity
function _claimInterest(address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
    _updateInterest(userAddr);  // State is updated before validation
    
    UserInfo storage user = users[userAddr];
    uint256 claimable = user.interestEarned;
    
    require(claimable > 0, "Nothing to claim");
    require(rewardsReserve >= claimable, "Insufficient rewards in contract");  // Validation occurs too late
    
    // Remaining function logic...
}
```
This incorrect ordering allows for scenarios where administrative actions (like withdrawing rewards) could leave the contract in a state where users are unable to claim their legitimately earned interest.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to stake tokens to accrue some interest in the contract
2. Admin needs to withdraw rewards from the contract to set rewardsReserve to be just enough to cover the user's pre-update interest amount
3. Time needs to pass between the last interest update and the claim attempt to allow additional interest to accrue
4. User needs to call claimInterest() which internally calls _updateInterest() before the rewards sufficiency check

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

This vulnerability doesn't present a direct attack vector for malicious exploitation, but rather creates a denial of service condition. Here's the sequence that leads to the issue:

1. User stakes tokens in the contract and begins accruing interest
2. Admin calls withdrawRewards(amount) to remove most of the rewards, leaving just enough to cover currently accrued interest
3. Time passes, causing additional interest to accrue (though not yet calculated in the contract state)
4. User calls claimInterest() to claim their rewards
5. The contract internally calls _updateInterest(userAddress) which increases the user's claimable interest amount
6. The contract checks if rewardsReserve >= claimable which now fails due to the additional accrued interest
7. The transaction reverts with "Insufficient rewards in contract"
8. User is unable to claim any interest, despite there being funds that could have covered their pre-update interest amount
This is not an exploitable attack but a logical flaw that creates a poor user experience and potentially locks user funds (in the form of earned interest) that should be claimable.

### Impact

The user cannot claim their legitimately earned interest when the rewards reserve is sufficient for their pre-update balance but insufficient for their post-update total. This creates a denial of service for reward claims, potentially locking user funds indefinitely in the form of accrued interest that cannot be withdrawn.

### PoC

Add this to your test suite in the LayerEdgeStakingTest.t.sol file:
```solidity
function test_ClaimInterest_InsufficientRewards_AfterInterestUpdate() public {
    // Arrange
    uint256 stakeAmount = MIN_STAKE; // Assume MIN_STAKE is defined and accessible
    uint256 initialRewardsReserve = staking.rewardsReserve();
    address user = alice; // Assume alice is a user with a staked balance

    console2.log("Initial rewards reserve:", initialRewardsReserve);
    console2.log("User address:", user);
    console2.log("Stake amount:", stakeAmount);

    // Act
    // User stakes a certain amount to accrue interest
    vm.startPrank(user);
    token.approve(address(staking), stakeAmount);
    staking.stake(stakeAmount);
    vm.stopPrank();

    console2.log("User staked successfully");
    
    // Check initial user info after staking
    (uint256 initialBalance, LayerEdgeStaking.Tier initialTier, uint256 initialApy, uint256 initialInterest) = staking.getUserInfo(user);
    console2.log("Initial staked balance:", initialBalance);
    console2.log("Initial tier:", uint256(initialTier));
    console2.log("Initial APY:", initialApy);
    console2.log("Initial pending interest:", initialInterest);

    // Advance time to accrue interest
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 30 days);
    console2.log("Advanced time by 30 days");

    // Check user info after time advancement but before withdrawal
    (uint256 balanceAfterTime, LayerEdgeStaking.Tier tierAfterTime, uint256 apyAfterTime, uint256 interestAfterTime) = staking.getUserInfo(user);
    console2.log("Staked balance after time advancement:", balanceAfterTime);
    console2.log("Tier after time advancement:", uint256(tierAfterTime));
    console2.log("APY after time advancement:", apyAfterTime);
    console2.log("Pending interest after time advancement:", interestAfterTime);
    console2.log("Rewards reserve before admin withdrawal:", staking.rewardsReserve());

    // Simulate rewards being nearly depleted by another process (e.g., admin withdrawal)
    vm.startPrank(admin); // Assume admin is the contract owner
    uint256 withdrawAmount = initialRewardsReserve - 1; // Leave only 1 token in rewards
    console2.log("Admin withdrawing rewards:", withdrawAmount);
    staking.withdrawRewards(withdrawAmount);
    vm.stopPrank();

    console2.log("Rewards reserve after admin withdrawal:", staking.rewardsReserve());

    // Get the updated interest that the user would claim
    (,,, uint256 pendingInterest) = staking.getUserInfo(user);
    console2.log("Updated pending interest for user:", pendingInterest);
    console2.log("Remaining rewards reserve:", staking.rewardsReserve());

    // Ensure that the rewards reserve is now less than what the user is about to claim
    // due to interest updates
    console2.log("Is pending interest > rewards reserve?", pendingInterest > staking.rewardsReserve());
    assertTrue(pendingInterest > staking.rewardsReserve(), "Updated interest should exceed rewards reserve");

    // User attempts to claim interest - expecting a revert due to insufficient rewards
    console2.log("User attempting to claim interest...");
    vm.startPrank(user);
    vm.expectRevert("Insufficient rewards in contract");
    staking.claimInterest();
    vm.stopPrank();
    console2.log("Claim attempt reverted as expected");

    // Assert
    // Check that the rewards reserve has not changed
    uint256 finalRewardsReserve = staking.rewardsReserve();
    console2.log("Final rewards reserve:", finalRewardsReserve);
    assertEq(finalRewardsReserve, initialRewardsReserve - withdrawAmount, "Rewards reserve should not have changed");

    // Check that the user's interest earned has not been claimed
    (,,, uint256 remainingInterest) = staking.getUserInfo(user);
    console2.log("Remaining unclaimed interest:", remainingInterest);
    assertEq(remainingInterest, pendingInterest, "User's interest should not have been claimed");
}
```

### Mitigation

Here's the code diff showing how to fix the vulnerability by checking rewards sufficiency before updating interest:
```solidity
function _claimInterest(address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
-    _updateInterest(userAddr);
-
    UserInfo storage user = users[userAddr];
    uint256 claimable = user.interestEarned;

    require(claimable > 0, "Nothing to claim");

    // Check if we have enough rewards in the contract
    require(rewardsReserve >= claimable, "Insufficient rewards in contract");

+    // Update interest calculation for future claims after checking current claimable amount
+    uint256 newInterest = calculateUnclaimedInterest(userAddr);
+
    user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;
    user.interestEarned = 0;
    user.totalClaimed += claimable;

    // Update rewards reserve
    rewardsReserve -= claimable;

    // Transfer tokens to user
    if (!isNative) {
        require(stakingToken.transfer(userAddr, claimable), "Token transfer failed");
    } else {
        IWETH(address(stakingToken)).withdraw(claimable);
        (bool success,) = payable(userAddr).call{value: claimable}("");
        require(success, "Claim interest native transfer failed");
    }

    emit RewardClaimed(userAddr, claimable);
}
```
