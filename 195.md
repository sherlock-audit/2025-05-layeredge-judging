# Whole protocol could be dos-ed due to how stake updates the tree size

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/library/FenwickTree.sol#L12


### Summary

In the `LayerEdgeStaking.sol` contract, the contract is initiallized with `MAX_USERS` being the tree size of the fenwickTree. In frenwick tree stuctures the size is constant an cannot be changed after initiazed.
The `stake` function is used to update the fenwick tree whenever the value being stored is greater than the minamount. This stores on the fenwick tree using the increment count, which is `nextJoinId++`, this increases evrything someone joins the tree structure.

when someone unstakes, theyre removes from the fenwick tree, however their index will still presist holding an unused slot in the fenwick tree structure, because the logic uses the `nextJoinId++` which is always increasing when someone joins, never decresing when they leave.

Over time when more people join, the tree size will make it to the max number and then not allow any more deposits above the minAmont. 


```javascript
 uint256 public constant MAX_USERS = 100_000_000;

 function _stake(uint256 amount, address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
        require(amount > 0, "Cannot stake zero amount");
'''
        // If first time staking, register staker position whose stake is more than minStakeAmount
        if (!user.isActive && amount >= minStakeAmount) {
=@            user.joinId = nextJoinId++;
=@            stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1);
            stakerAddress[user.joinId] = userAddr;
            user.isActive = true;
            stakerCountInTree++;

            uint256 rank = stakerTree.query(user.joinId);
            tier = _computeTierByRank(rank, stakerCountInTree);
            user.isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake = true;

            _recordTierChange(userAddr, tier);
            _checkBoundariesAndRecord(false);
        }

  function _unstake(uint256 amount, address userAddr) internal {
       
        if (!user.outOfTree && user.balance < minStakeAmount) {
            // execute this before removing from tree, this will make sure to calculate interest
            //for amount left after unstake
            _recordTierChange(userAddr, Tier.Tier3);
=@            stakerTree.update(user.joinId, -1);
            stakerCountInTree--;
            user.outOfTree = true;
            stakerCountOutOfTree++;
            _checkBoundariesAndRecord(true);


//FenwickTree.sol
              function update(Tree storage self, uint256 index, int256 delta) internal {
        require(index > 0, "Index must be > 0");
        while (index <= self.size) {
            self.data[index] = uint256(int256(self.data[index]) + delta);
            index += lsb(index);
        }
    }
 
```
Whenever a new using is staking the fenwick tree update checks if the index is <= the size of the tree.

Since the size of the tree continues to grow with the increase of `nextJoinId++` , over time this will brick the protocol.



### Root Cause

The `nextJoinId` always increases and never is reduced.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. 1. nextJoinId increases

### External Pre-conditions

1. users stake
2. next join id increases
3. users unstake, next joinid isnt affectedecomes greater than the tree size

### Attack Path

nextJoinId = 1
tree size = 4
- user1 stakes an amount > min Amount
- the `nextJoinId++`  icreases = 2
- user1 unstakes
- user2 stakes an amount > min Amount
- the `nextJoinId++`  icreases = 3
- user2 unstakes
- - user3 stakes an amount > min Amount
- the `nextJoinId++`  icreases = 4
- user3 unstakes
  - user4 stakes an amount > min Amount
-  tree size limit is reached and the update work work
  

### Impact

overtime the `nextJoinId++` will reach the max size and even when the total stakers are not even up to half the size and brick the system.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- user the input vale as the increase instead of the `nextJoinId` , when the tree is updated with the users values its more efficient in Fenwick trees, as the values gets updated and new values gets added, without bricking the system over time.
