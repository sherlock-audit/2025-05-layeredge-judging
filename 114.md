# Token Type Mismatch in LayerEdgeStaking Contract

### Summary

The contract fails to track and enforce consistency between native (ETH) and non-native (ERC20) token operations in three critical functions:

- Staking/Unstaking
- Interest claiming

### Root Cause


The core issue is that the contract doesn't store or validate the original staking method `(isNative` flag when performing subsequent operations, allowing users to freely choose between native and non-native methods regardless of how they originally staked.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract must be deployed and initialized with both WETH and ERC20 token support
2. The contract must have sufficient balance of both token types (WETH and ERC20)
3. The attacker must have either:
          ERC20 tokens to stake, or
          Native ETH to stake

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

#### Path 1: ERC20 Stake → Native ETH Unstake

1. Attacker stakes ERC20 tokens using stake()
2. Attacker requests unstake using unstake()
3. After unstaking window (7 days), attacker calls completeUnstakeNative()
4. Attacker receives native ETH instead of ERC20 tokens

#### Path 2: Native ETH Stake → ERC20 Unstake

1. Attacker stakes native ETH using stakeNative()
2. Attacker requests unstake using unstake()
3. After unstaking window, attacker calls completeUnstake()
4. Attacker receives ERC20 tokens instead of native ETH

#### Path 3: Interest Claim Mismatch

1. Attacker stakes tokens (either method)
2. Wait for interest to accrue
3. Claim interest using the opposite method of staking:
                  For ERC20 stake: Use claimInterestNative()
                  For Native stake: Use claimInterest()

### Impact

1. Fund Loss: Users can receive funds in a different token type than they staked
2. Contract Balance Imbalance:
      - WETH balance can be drained by ERC20 stakers
      - ERC20 balance can be drained by native ETH stakers
3. System Integrity: Breaks the expected 1:1 relationship between staking and unstaking/claiming methods
4. Potential DoS: Other users' operations might fail if the contract runs out of a particular token type

### Mitigation

1. Track Staking Method

2. Enforce Consistency in Unstaking

3. Enforce Consistency in Interest Claims
