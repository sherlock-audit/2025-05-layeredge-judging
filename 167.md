# A front-running spender can drain the wrapped Edgen tokens from a user by exploiting approve overwrite logic

### Summary

The lack of a zero-reset check in the `approve()` function will cause a token loss for token holders as a front-running spender will exploit the approval race condition by spending the old allowance before the new one takes effect.



### Root Cause


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/WETH9.sol#L37C2-L41C6

In `WETH9.sol`, the `approve()` function directly overwrites the existing allowance without requiring it to be reset to zero beforehand:

```solidity
allowance[msg.sender][guy] = wad;
```

Since the allowance is updated after the transaction is mined, a malicious spender can front-run the second approve() call by submitting a `transferFrom()` that spends the full old allowance (100 tokens) while the transaction is still in the mempool.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A token holder has previously approved a non-zero allowance to a spender.

The holder submits a transaction to change the spender’s allowance to a new value.

The contract's `approve()` logic does not validate or reset the existing allowance before updating it.

### External Pre-conditions

The attacker (spender) monitors the mempool.

The attacker observes the holder’s transaction to update their allowance.

The attacker front-runs this transaction with a `transferFrom()` that uses the old (higher) allowance.

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

The attacker can drain the entire previous allowance before the new one is set, resulting in unauthorized token loss for the token holder.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the `approve()` function to require a zero-reset before updating non-zero allowances.
