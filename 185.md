# Join-ID exhaustion lets anyone freeze new participation long before the MAX_USERS cap is “naturally” reached

### Summary

_nextJoinId_ is monotonically incremented and never re-used.
An attacker can create a large number of one-off addresses that each stake the minimum amount once and then leave.
Because every first stake consumes a join-ID permanently while MAX_USERS is fixed (README: “Fenwick tree size fixed at 100 000 000”), the attacker can push nextJoinId above MAX_USERS.
From that moment every subsequent stake by any honest newcomer reverts, permanently locking new users out of the protocol even though the tree itself may hold only a handful of active stakers.

### Root Cause

In _stake():

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L701

user.joinId = nextJoinId++;          // joinId never recycled
stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1);   // → reverts when joinId > MAX_USERS


When a user later leaves (or is demoted to outOfTree) their joinId
slot is not freed and cannot be re-assigned.

### Internal Pre-conditions

MAX_USERS is left at the advertised 100 000 000.
The attacker controls a script able to create fresh EOAs or cheap CREATE2 contracts.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

For i = 1 … 100 000 001 a. deploy new address Aᵢ b. Aᵢ.stake(minStakeAmount) – consumes a join-ID c. (optional) Aᵢ.unstake() – gas-optimises the attack but is not required
After the loop nextJoinId == MAX_USERS + 1.
Any honest user who now calls stake() triggers stakerTree.update(MAX_USERS+1, 1) → Fenwick tree reverts.
New participation is impossible; attacker spent ~200 M gas (≈ 5 ETH at 25 gwei) once.

### Impact

The staking protocol is effectively “write-locked”:
• no new addresses can enter Tier 1/2/3;
• existing stakers can still operate, but ecosystem growth stops.
The attack is pure griefing: attacker loses only gas, gains nothing, but
can execute it at any time.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Option A – hard upper-bound check (fast patch)

require(nextJoinId < MAX_USERS, "maximum number of stakers reached");
This makes the failure explicit and prevents gas waste, but still leaves
the protocol unable to grow.

Option B – recycle or expand join-IDs (recommended)

Keep a stack of freed join-IDs (addresses that are outOfTree && balance == 0), and reuse one instead of incrementing nextJoinId.
Or change the Fenwick implementation to accept dynamic size growth beyond the initial MAX_USERS, then update the tree’s size variable in place.
With reuse or dynamic growth in place the attacker cannot exhaust the
ID space and honest users remain able to join indefinitely
