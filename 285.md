# DoS in update function in FenwickTree.sol.

### Summary

The ```update``` function in ```FenwickTree.sol``` updates the value on the provided index and the parent indexes but if the tree becomes large like provided in the protocol ```uint256 public constant MAX_USERS = 100_000_000```, the updation of values in the nodes will eat all the gas and will lead to a ```Denial Of Service``` and unexpected reverts.

### Root Cause

The protocol utilizes a Fenwick Tree for data management, specifically for handling ```joinIds``` for up to 100,000,000 users. The ```update function```, as provided, is designed to update values at a given ```index``` or ```join Id``` and its ancestors in the tree.

A user calling ```update``` with a small index (e.g., index = 1) will trigger a loop with up to log₂(size) iterations. For size = 100_000_000, this could involve up to ```27 iterations```, each of which updates storage (very expensive in gas).

As the number of updates grows and depending on the delta and index distribution, the gas cost can easily exceed the block limit, making the function unusable. In turn, this could:

i) Prevent legitimate users from updating their records.
ii) Render key contract functionality unusable.
iii) Lead to loss of funds or frozen state in systems relying on this update path.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Just requires to call the ```update``` function even once when the list of users who are updated on the tree reaches the provided number or even less. The ```update``` will trigger a loop which will keep updating the parent nodes until it keeps finding the valid index for updation.
2. This vulnerability is valid on both the scenarios, ```stake()``` and ```unstake()```. But, generally will be caused by calling ```unstake``` when user's position id will be updated and all the parent nodes will be updated accordingly.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Only requires the list of the user's to go somewhere near the chosen limit of maximum users which is ```uint256 public constant MAX_USERS = 100_000_000```. This will be enough to cause the DoS.

### Attack Path

1. Users Stake token, the list grows to a large number.
2. Some user's may ```unstake``` and ```update``` the list, this will lead to call the ```update``` function which will definitely eat all the gas and result in DoS.

### Impact

I . **Severity**: Critical
II. **Category**: Denial of Service (DoS), Gas Limit Exceeded

The high gas consumption in the ```update``` function leads to a critical Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability:

1.**Functional Impairment**: Users will be unable to successfully call the ```update``` function, preventing them from 
   registering for ```joinIds``` or performing any other operations that rely on this function.
2. **Protocol Unusability**: The Fenwick Tree is central to the protocol's data management, this vulnerability will 
   render the entire protocol unusable for its intended scale of ```100,000,000 users```.
3. **Economic DoS**: Even if the transaction barely fits within the block gas limit, the extremely high gas fees would 
   deter legitimate users from interacting with the contract.
4. **Griefing Attack Vector**: An attacker could potentially spam the network with update transactions, driving up 
    gas prices and further hindering legitimate user interaction, or simply making the protocol non-operational.

### PoC

**A simple PoC which show the out of bound gas consumption of update function:-**

Added some console logs to ```update``` function to show how many times this will iterate
```solidity
function update(Tree storage self, uint256 index, int256 delta) internal {
        require(index > 0, "Index must be > 0");
        while (index <= self.size) {
            self.data[index] = uint256(int256(self.data[index]) + delta);
            console2.log("updated the index: ", index);
            console2.log("with value: ", int256(self.data[index]) + delta);
            index += lsb(index);
        }
    }
```
**PoC:-**
Fails with even 100_000 users in tree
```solidity
function testfindByCumulativeFrequencyFunctionTwo() public {
        uint256 index1 = tree.findByCumulativeFrequency(20);
        assertEq(index1, 20);
        tree.update(18, 5);
        uint256 index2 = tree.findByCumulativeFrequency(20);
        assertEq(index2, 18);
        tree.update(7, 10);
        uint256 index3 = tree.findByCumulativeFrequency(20);
        uint256 sum = tree.query(8);
        console2.log("sum is : ", sum);
        assertEq(index3, 10);
    }
```
**Results of the Test, setUp used is already given in the Test file by Protocol:-**

```solidity
← [MemoryLimitOOG] EvmError: MemoryLimitOOG
Suite result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 8.09s (0.00ns CPU time)
```
**with** ```MAX_USERS```
1. Set the ```_fillTree()``` function ```MAX_USERS``` size and then run this test

```solidity
function testGasOutofBoundUsageWithMaxUsers() public {
        // calling update at zero will eat all the gas and result in a DoS
        tree.update(1, 0);
    }
```


### Mitigation

This is a critical design flaw that fundamentally undermines the protocol's ability to function at its stated scale of ```100,000,000``` users. The gas consumption for a single ```update``` operation on a Fenwick Tree of this magnitude is prohibitively ```high``` and will inevitably lead to transactions failing or becoming economically unfeasible.

The current approach to managing ```joinIds``` via an on-chain Fenwick Tree for such a large user base is not viable on the Ethereum blockchain due to its gas constraints. Attention is required to re-architect the data management strategy for ```joinId``` allocation. The team should seriously consider moving the Fenwick Tree logic off-chain or adopting a completely different, more gas-efficient mechanism for ID management and any required data aggregation.
