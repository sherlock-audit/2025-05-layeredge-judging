# Users might be unable to operate due to OOG error

### Summary

Users might be unable to operate due to OOG error

### Root Cause

The operation for updating interest is gas intensive as it iterates over loops. It iterates both from the user's tier history:
```solidity
        for (uint256 i = relevantStartIndex + 1; i < userTierHistory.length; i++) {
               // ...
        }
```
As well as through different APY periods:
```solidity
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < apyPeriods.length; i++) {
            // ...
        }
```

### Attack Path

1. User is on the edge of a tier, e.g. he is at the 2nd rank and there are 10 stakers, thus as soon as someone unstakes he goes to rank 1 and as soon as someone stakes again, he goes to rank 2, every time this happens, a period is pushed in his array:
```solidity
        stakerTierHistory[user].push(TierEvent({ from: old, to: newTier, timestamp: currentTime }));
```
2. Using a simple test, we will see that it can take up to 100k just for a single iteration:
```solidity
    function testGasIssue() public {
        for (uint256 i; i < 10; i++) {
            address user = address(uint160(i + 1));
            deal(address(token), user, 3000e18);
            vm.startPrank(user);
            token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE);
            staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
        }

        address victim = address(2);

        skip(365 days);
        
        vm.startPrank(victim);
        uint256 gasBefore = gasleft();
        staking.claimInterest();
        uint256 gasAfter = gasleft();
        console.log(gasBefore - gasAfter);
    }
```
3. The block gas limit on Ethereum is 30M, so if we assume 100K gas per iteration, then 300 iterations are sufficient to go OOG
4. User is unable to withdraw/claim interest and other similar operations

NOTE: This might be an attack or it might happen accidentally overtime. 

It can happen on purpose by a griefer. If we assume that the `EDGEN` token is worth 1 cent (very likely), then each deposit and unstake will cost the user `3000 * 0.01 = 30` (due to the minimum stake) or a total of 9,000\$ for all iterations. Note that these funds are not lost but are just locked for a week due to the protocol's functionality.

### Impact

Critical - users are unable to unstake, claim interest and other similar operations as all such operations update the interest.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider a more gas-friendly approach
