# Double counting of `totalCalimed` leads to wrong `totalClaimed` in `UserInfo`.

### Summary

The `compountInterest()` function in the `LayerEdgeStaking.sol` when compounding interest,adds the `totalCliamed` with the `claimable` amount of a user by updating the `users `mapping.But when a user claims the interest using the `claimInterest()` function, internally it again updates the `users` mapping of the user info by again adding the `totalClaimed`  with the `claimable` amount.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L792

we can see from the above link that the UserInfo is updated in the `compoundInterest()` function and the `_claimInterest()` function.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. compounding should be enabled by the admin
2. user should compound their interest using the `compoundInterest()` function.
3. user should claim their interest using the `claimInterest()` function.

### External Pre-conditions

Nil

### Attack Path

Nil

### Impact

This leads to wrong user information being tracked by the contract on users when claiming their interest.

### PoC


paste this test in the `LayerEdgeStakingTest.t.sol` contract and run `forge test --mt test_TotalClaimedDoubleCalculation -vv`.

for this test i have made the initial token balance of alice to `MIN_STAKE` for easier calculation.

```solidity
    function test_TotalClaimedDoubleCalculation() external {
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE);
        staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
        console2.log("initial token balance after staking:", token.balanceOf(alice));

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 7 days);
        staking.compoundInterest();
        (,,, uint256 totalClaimedAfterCompound,,,,,) = staking.users(alice);
        console2.log("totalClaimed after compounding:", totalClaimedAfterCompound);

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 7 days);
        staking.claimInterest();
        (,,, uint256 totalClaimedAfterCompoundClaim,,,,,) = staking.users(alice);
        console2.log("final totalClaimed after claiming interest:", totalClaimedAfterCompoundClaim);
        console2.log("final token balance of alice:", token.balanceOf(alice));
        console2.log("difference between the totalClaim:", totalClaimedAfterCompoundClaim - totalClaimedAfterCompound);
    }
```

  difference between the totalClaim: 29042972415087258397
```
We can see from the test that after compounding, when a user claims their interest ,it is double calculating the totalClaimed.The test showcase that their difference(because of the calculation error) is actually reflected in the users account.

The calculation error only happens when compounding is enabled, we can actually check that with another test.Run this test using `forge test --mt testCorrectlyCalculatesWithoutCompounding -vv`

```solidity
    function testCorrectlyCalculatesWithoutCompounding() external {
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE);
        staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
        console2.log("initial token balance after staking:", token.balanceOf(alice));
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 7 days);
        staking.claimInterest();
        (,,, uint256 totalClaimedAfterCompoundClaim,,,,,) = staking.users(alice);
        console2.log("final totalClaimed after claiming interest:", totalClaimedAfterCompoundClaim);
        console2.log("final token balance of alice:", token.balanceOf(alice));
    }
```

```
we can see from the logs that the balance of alice actually reflect the same as the `totalClaimed` which is correct.

### Mitigation

remove this line from the `compoundInterest()` function.Also the lastClaimTime can be updated because it is also updated when claiming interest so dont need to update when compounding interest.
```diff
   function compoundInterest() external whenCompoundingEnabled nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    _updateInterest(msg.sender);
    UserInfo storage user = users[msg.sender];
    //rest of the code..
-    user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;
-   user.totalClaimed += claimable;
    //rest of the code...

   }
```
