# Missing Zero Address Check in `initialize` Function Allows Permanent Lockout of Admin Controls


## Summary

The `initialize` function does not validate that the `_admin` parameter is a non-zero address. As a result, it is possible to set the contract owner to `address(0)`, permanently disabling access to all `onlyOwner` functions and administrative controls.

## Root Cause

Within the `initialize(address _stakingToken, address _admin)` function.https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L129
, there is a `require` check for `_stakingToken` but none for `_admin`. Consequently, `__Ownable_init(_admin)` can be called with a zero address, irreversibly setting `address(0)` as the contract's owner.

```solidity
function initialize(address _stakingToken, address _admin) public initializer {
    require(_stakingToken != address(0), "Invalid token address");
    stakingToken = IERC20(_stakingToken);
    __Ownable_init(_admin);
    __Pausable_init();
    __ReentrancyGuard_init();
    // ... rest of initialization ...
}
```

## Internal Preconditions

* Contract uses OpenZeppelinâ€™s `OwnableUpgradeable` and assigns ownership through `__Ownable_init(_admin)`.
* The `initializer` modifier allows this function to run only once.
* No input validation exists for the `_admin` parameter.

## External Preconditions

* The deployer provides `address(0)` as the `_admin` argument during initialization.
* No prior ownership or admin setup has been performed.

## Attack Path

1. Deploy proxy with implementation.
2. Call `initialize(stakingTokenAddress, address(0))`.
3. Contract sets the owner to `address(0)`.
4. All calls to `onlyOwner` functions (e.g., `pause()`, `setCompoundingStatus()`) permanently revert.

## Impact

* Permanent loss of admin-level privileges, including the ability to pause the contract, change parameters, or upgrade logic.
* The contract becomes unmanageable, posing a risk to users and protocol funds.
* Emergency response and governance are effectively disabled.

## Proof of Concept

```solidity
function test_initializeWithZeroAdmin() external {
    address owner; // implicitly address(0)

    LayerEdgeStaking implementation = new LayerEdgeStaking();

    LayerEdgeStaking proxy = LayerEdgeStaking(
        payable(
            address(
                new ERC1967Proxy(
                    address(implementation),
                    abi.encodeWithSelector(
                        implementation.initialize.selector,
                        address(stakingToken),
                        owner
                    )
                )
            )
        )
    );

    // Confirm owner is address(0)
    assertEq(proxy.owner(), address(0));

    // Attempting an admin-only action should revert
    vm.expectRevert("Ownable: caller is not the owner");
    proxy.pause();
}
```

## Recommendation

Add a `require` check to validate that `_admin` is not the zero address:

```solidity
function initialize(address _stakingToken, address _admin) public initializer {
    require(_stakingToken != address(0), "Invalid token address");
    require(_admin != address(0), "Invalid admin address");
    stakingToken = IERC20(_stakingToken);
    __Ownable_init(_admin);
    __Pausable_init();
    __ReentrancyGuard_init();
    // ... rest of initialization ...
}
```

This ensures that ownership is always assigned to a valid address, maintaining administrative control over the contract.
