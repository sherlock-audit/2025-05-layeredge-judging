# High interest amounts could become unclaimable

### Summary

Users are expected to use `claimInterest()` to get their staking rewards. This function tries to send all the unclaimed interest to caller (if contract has enough rewards available for the amount being demanded) and reverts in case the claimed amount is higher than contract's available reward amount.

### Root Cause

Users with high amount of pending rewards to claim may find that it is very difficult or impossible for them to claim their rewards:

According to sponsors, periodic depositRewards should be made to increase available rewards in the contract and users are able to claim. Stakers with low rewards to claim will have no problem to get their reward, however stakers that have accrued high reward quantities are likely to find that the contract has not enough rewards to pay them (due to other users having claimed before or not enough rewards were deposited by depositors).

As a result, these stakers would find it difficult or impossible to claim their staked amount, since the contract tries to claim all the accrued reward instead of letting users select how much of their accrued rewards they would like to claim.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Alice has accrued over long time a rewards of 10000 tokens.
2. Bob and Charlie have accrued a rewards of 1000 tokens each.
3. 7000 tokens are deposited as rewards into the contract.

### Attack Path

1. Alice calls `claimInterest()`, which reverts as contract's available rewards (7000) is lower than Alice's unclaimed interest (10000).
2. Bob and Charlie succesfully call `claimInterest()`, obtaining their rewards.
3. Contract's available rewards get lower because of other stakers claiming, while Alice's unclaimed rewards keep growing up, becoming even more difficult to claim them.

### Impact

Users with high amount of unclaimed rewards may experience difficulties to get them claimed. In the best case, they could be able to claim them if they are quick enough to claim when new rewards are deposited and deposited rewards are high enough to fulfill their claim.

In the worst case, if affected user's unclaimed rewards became higher than the amount of rewards sponsors deposit, user will probably never be able to get their interest claim (take into account that available rewards will be quickly lowered because of other users claiming), leading to user never being able to claim rewards (net loss of rewards).

### Mitigation

Update `_claimInterest()` function so that amount to be claimed becomes the current available rewards, this allows users to claim their rewards in several times as new rewards are deposited:

```solidity
function _claimInterest(address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
        _updateInterest(userAddr);

        UserInfo storage user = users[userAddr];
        uint256 claimable = user.interestEarned;

+      claimable = claimable > rewardsReserve ? rewardsReserve : claimable;
        require(claimable > 0, "Nothing to claim");

        // Check if we have enough rewards in the contract
-      require(rewardsReserve >= claimable, "Insufficient rewards in contract");

        user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;
        user.interestEarned = 0;
        user.totalClaimed += claimable;

        // Update rewards reserve
        rewardsReserve -= claimable;

        // Transfer tokens to user
        if (!isNative) {
            require(stakingToken.transfer(userAddr, claimable), "Token transfer failed");
        } else {
            IWETH(address(stakingToken)).withdraw(claimable);
            (bool success,) = payable(userAddr).call{value: claimable}("");
            require(success, "Claim interest native transfer failed");
        }

        emit RewardClaimed(userAddr, claimable);
    }
```
