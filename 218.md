# stakerCountOutOfTree Not Decremented When Balance Hits Zero

### Summary

`stakerCountOutOfTree` tracks the number of stakers that are staking, but have a balance below `minStakeAmount`.

When a user unstakes and their balance is reduced to 0, `stakerCountOutOfTree` should be decremented to reflect that they are no longer a staker, but it isn't.

### Root Cause

`_unstake` doesn't check if the user.balance is 0 and if it is, decrement `stakerCountOutOfTree`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A staker unstakes their entire position, so their balance is 0.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Staker unstakes their entire position, so their balance is 0
2. `stakerCountOutOfTree` doesn't get decremented.
3. The UI uses `getAllStakingInfo` to show number of `stakerCountOutOfTree`.

### Impact

Because `stakerCountOutOfTree` will be inflated, it'll look to users that the protocol isn't following the tier split (e.g. 20% T1, 30% T2, 50% T3) which damages the protocols reputation and can cause a decrease in TVL and price of the stakedToken.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Decrement `stakerCountOutOfTree` when a user unstakes to a zero balance.
