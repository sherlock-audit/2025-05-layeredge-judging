# Admin can allow staking below minStakeAmount, undermining economic assumptions of protocol participants in `LayerEdgeStaking`

### Summary

The missing validation in LayerEdgeStaking.sol allows the admin to set `minStakeAmount` to an uneconomically low value (e.g., 40 wei), which will cause reward dilution and storage bloat for legitimate stakers as attackers or bots can enter Tier 1 and Tier 2 using less than the default stake amounts, but only until the next setStakeAmount.

### Root Cause

In layerEdgeStaking.soL:334 there is no limit to how low then minStakeAmount can be set  in `setMinStakeAmount`
```Javascript
/**
 * @notice Set the minimum stake amount
 * @param amount The new minimum stake amount
 */
function setMinStakeAmount(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    minStakeAmount = amount;
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to call setMinStakeAmount() to set minStakeAmount to a very low amount of the required token.
2.  Users in other tiers have to unstake below the the default minStakeAmount and retain their positions in their tiers
3.  other users will stake just a little above the current stakers to be promoted to a higher tier.

### External Pre-conditions

nil

### Attack Path


nil


### Impact

1. Tier System Disruption: Allowing `minStakeAmount` to be set below 3000 EDGEN could enable users to join the tier system (Fenwick Tree) with minimal stakes, potentially flooding Tier 1 and Tier 2 with users who do not meet the intended staking threshold.
2. Economic Implications: Lowering the minimum stake amount could dilute the rewards structure, as more users could qualify for higher tiers without significant investment, affecting the APY distribution and fairness of the system.
3. Contract Integrity: The lack of validation deviates from the documented requirement, potentially leading to governance or operational issues if the minimum stake is set inappropriately.

### PoC

```Javascript
staking.setMinStakeAmount(ZERO_STAKE);

 function test_LayerEdgeStaking_Unstake() public {
        // Alice stakes
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        token.approve(address(staking), LARGE_STAKE);
        staking.stake(LARGE_STAKE);
        vm.stopPrank();

    //     // Record balances before unstaking
         uint256 contractBalanceBefore = token.balanceOf(address(staking));
         uint256 aliceBalanceBefore = token.balanceOf(alice);
         console.log(aliceBalanceBefore);
         console.log(contractBalanceBefore);

    //     // Check initial stake balance
         (uint256 initialBalance,,,) = staking.getUserInfo(alice);
         assertEq(initialBalance, LARGE_STAKE);

         vm.startPrank(alice);
         staking.unstake(LARGE_STAKE / 4);
         staking.unstake(4700 * 1e18);
         staking.unstake(LARGE_STAKE / 4);
         vm.stopPrank();

 
    //     // Check Alice's tier after unstaking
        (, LayerEdgeStaking.Tier tierAfterUnstake,,) = staking.getUserInfo(alice);
    console.log("Alice's tier after unstaking:", uint256(tierAfterUnstake));
```


### Mitigation

```javascript
function setMinStakeAmount(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    require(amount >= 3000 * 1e18, "Minimum stake amount must be at least 3000 EDGEN");
    minStakeAmount = amount;
}
```
