# Unsafe Native Token Transfers

### Summary

Native ETH/WETH unwrapping functions use low-level call without checking return data length.

### Root Cause

Simplistic success check without require(returnedData.length >= 0).

### Internal Pre-conditions

User calls unstakeNative() or claimInterestNative().

### External Pre-conditions

Receiver is a contract whose fallback uses >2300 gas or reverts on empty calldata.

### Attack Path

Transfer fails silently or reverts, locking user funds or halting contract execution.

### Impact

High: locked funds in staking contract or denial of service for native claims.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

• Use OpenZeppelin’s Address.sendValue() which reverts on failure.
• Wrap in try/catch and revert with a clear error if the transfer fails.
