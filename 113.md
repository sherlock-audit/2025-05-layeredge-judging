# Stakers Can Indefinitely Retain Top Tier Status Without Unstaking, Enabling Reward Monopolization

### Summary

The ```_recordTierChange ``` function only retains the tier assigned during a user’s initial stake, causing early stakers who remain continuously staked—even after long periods of inactivity—to retain Tier 1 status indefinitely. This allows these stakers to deposit additional amounts at any time and receive the highest rewards unfairly, bypassing the First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) tier allocation. Since the user does not unstake during inactivity, their tier does not reset, enabling them to monopolize Tier 1 rewards and block newer stakers from accessing the highest tier benefits.



### Root Cause

```solidity
function _recordTierChange(address user, Tier newTier) internal {
        // Get current tier
        Tier old = Tier.Tier3;

        if (stakerTierHistory[user].length > 0) {
            old = stakerTierHistory[user][stakerTierHistory[user].length - 1].to;
        }

        // If this is the same tier as before, no change to record
        if (
            stakerTierHistory[user].length > 0
                && stakerTierHistory[user][stakerTierHistory[user].length - 1].to == newTier    
        ) return;

        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

        //push event - ensure neither from nor to is Tier.None
        stakerTierHistory[user].push(TierEvent({from: old, to: newTier, timestamp: currentTime}));  // audit 

        users[user].lastTimeTierChanged = currentTime;    

        emit TierChanged(user, newTier);
    }
```

The function only updates a staker’s tier history upon new stakes or after they have unstaked; however, if a staker never unstakes, their tier remains locked at their initial tier (e.g., Tier 1), allowing them to continuously add stake and receive the highest rewards indefinitely, bypassing fair tier rotation.


### Internal Pre-conditions

Nill

### External Pre-conditions

Here’s a paraphrased version of the external pre-conditions:

1. The attacker initially stakes the `MIN_STAKE` amount early on and obtains Tier 1 status.
2. The attacker observes that he is  the sole participant in Tier 1.
3. The attacker then stakes a `LARGE_STAKE` to maximize their rewards.
4. The attacker repeats this process continuously to maintain and increase his benefits.


### Attack Path

### Impact

This allows the attacker to monopolize Tier 1 rewards, preventing other stakers from having the opportunity to attain Tier 1 status and earn its benefits. Additionally, this unfair advantage can extend to other tiers, blocking newer stakers from accessing higher-tier rewards.

### PoC

```solidity
 function test_LayerEdgeStaking_TierSystem_OneStaker() public {
        // Alice stakes minimum amount
        vm.startPrank(alice);

        // Approve tokens
        token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE);

        vm.expectEmit(true, false, false, false);
        emit LayerEdgeStaking.Staked(alice, MIN_STAKE, LayerEdgeStaking.Tier.Tier1); // First staker should be tier 1
        staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Check tier counts with one staker
        (uint256 tier1Count, uint256 tier2Count, uint256 tier3Count) = staking.getTierCounts();
        console2.log("tier1Count", tier1Count);
        console2.log("tier2Count", tier2Count);
        console2.log("tier3Count", tier3Count);



        assertEq(tier1Count, 1);
        assertEq(tier2Count, 0);
        assertEq(tier3Count, 0);

        // Check Alice's tier and APY
        (, LayerEdgeStaking.Tier tier, uint256 apy,) = staking.getUserInfo(alice);
         
         console2.log("tier1", uint256(tier1));

        assertEq(uint256(tier), uint256(LayerEdgeStaking.Tier.Tier1));
        assertEq(apy, 50 * PRECISION);

        // Check token balances
        assertEq(token.balanceOf(address(staking)), 100_000 * 1e18 + MIN_STAKE); // Rewards + stake
        assertEq(token.balanceOf(alice), 100_000 * 1e18 - MIN_STAKE);


        // checking when a user restake high amount to check what tier alice is going to be after 365 days 

          vm.startPrank(alice);

        // Approve tokens
        token.approve(address(staking), LARGE_STAKE);

        vm.expectEmit(true, false, false, false);
        emit LayerEdgeStaking.Staked(alice, LARGE_STAKE, LayerEdgeStaking.Tier.Tier1);

        // The user restakes a year later that is 365 days
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 365 days);   // after a year  (This time frame is used for testing purposes , it could be less )

        staking.stake(LARGE_STAKE);
        vm.stopPrank();


        // Check if the  tier  is the same as the first time that alice staked after a year 
        (uint256 tier1Count1, uint256 tier2Count2, uint256 tier3Count3) = staking.getTierCounts();
        console2.log("tier1Count", tier1Count1);    // tiers are the same from the first time that alice staked 
        console2.log("tier2Count", tier2Count2);
        console2.log("tier3Count", tier3Count3);

        assertEq(tier1Count1, 1);
        assertEq(tier2Count2, 0);
        assertEq(tier3Count3, 0);

        // Check Alice's tier and APY
        (, LayerEdgeStaking.Tier tier1, uint256 apy1,) = staking.getUserInfo(alice);

        console2.log("tier1", uint256(tier1));

        assertEq(uint256(tier1), uint256(LayerEdgeStaking.Tier.Tier1));
        assertEq(apy1, 50 * PRECISION);

        // Check token balances
        assertEq(token.balanceOf(address(staking)), 100_000 * 1e18 + MIN_STAKE + LARGE_STAKE); 
        assertEq(token.balanceOf(alice), 100_000 * 1e18 - MIN_STAKE - LARGE_STAKE);
    }
  
```

### Mitigation

Combining resetting tiers on unstake with dynamic, periodic recalculation of tiers helps maintain fairness and prevents monopolization of rewards.

1. Modify the _recordTierChange function to update the tier history and recalculate the user’s tier based on the current staking conditions every time they stake, regardless of past tiers.
