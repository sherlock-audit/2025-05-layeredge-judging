# Inconsistent Rewards Reserve Management for Native and ERC20 Tokens

### Summary
The `LayerEdgeStaking` contract uses a single `rewardsReserve` to track rewards, which is maintained with ERC20 tokens. However, this reserve is affected by actions involving native tokens, leading to potential inconsistencies and financial discrepancies. This can result in an inaccurate representation of available rewards, affecting the protocol's ability to manage and distribute rewards effectively.

### Vulnerability Details
- **Root Cause**: `rewardsReserve` is in ERC20 token but even reduced for native token also
- **Components Affected**: `rewardsReserve`, `_claimInterest`, `compoundInterest`
- **Impact**: The `rewardsReserve` is inaccurately reduced during native token interactions, leading to potential discrepancies in reward tracking and distribution.
The price of the native token and the ERC20 token are not going to same.

#### Q: Is the codebase expected to comply with any specific EIPs?
2. ERC-20: For the staking token interactions (stakingToken) and reward distributions ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ

### Exploit Scenario
1. **Rewards Reserve Initialization**:
   - The `rewardsReserve` is initialized and managed with ERC20 tokens, as indicated by the [depositRewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L298) function.

```Solidity
    /**
     * @notice Deposit tokens to be used as rewards
     * @param amount Amount to deposit
     */
    function depositRewards(uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        require(amount > 0, "Cannot deposit zero amount");

        // Update rewards reserve
        rewardsReserve += amount;

        // Transfer tokens from sender to contract
        require(stakingToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount), "Token transfer failed");

        emit RewardsDeposited(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```

2. **Claiming Interest in Native Tokens**:
   - A user claims interest in native tokens using the `claimInterestNative` function.
   - The `rewardsReserve` is reduced by the claimed amount, even though the interest is paid in native tokens.

3. **Compounding Interest**:
   - A user compounds interest earned from native token staking using the [compoundInterest#L225](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L225) function.
   - The `rewardsReserve` is again reduced, despite the interest being in native tokens.

4. **Inaccurate Rewards Tracking**:
   - The `rewardsReserve` no longer accurately reflects the available ERC20 rewards, potentially leading to over-distribution or under-distribution of rewards.

### Steps to Exploit
1. **Claim Interest in Native Tokens**:

Here user claims in native, but it gets reduced in the `rewardsReserve`, which is ERC20

   ```Solidity
   function claimInterestNative() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
       _claimInterest(msg.sender, true);
   }

    function _claimInterest(address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
        _updateInterest(userAddr);

        UserInfo storage user = users[userAddr];
        uint256 claimable = user.interestEarned;

        require(claimable > 0, "Nothing to claim");

        // Check if we have enough rewards in the contract
        require(rewardsReserve >= claimable, "Insufficient rewards in contract");

        user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;
        user.interestEarned = 0;
        user.totalClaimed += claimable;

        // Update rewards reserve
        rewardsReserve -= claimable; ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ

        // Transfer tokens to user
        if (!isNative) {
            require(stakingToken.transfer(userAddr, claimable), "Token transfer failed");
        } else {
            IWETH(address(stakingToken)).withdraw(claimable);
            (bool success,) = payable(userAddr).call{value: claimable}("");
            require(success, "Claim interest native transfer failed");
        }

        emit RewardClaimed(userAddr, claimable);
    }
   ```

2. **Compound Interest from Native Tokens (when user balance in native token)**:
   
[compoundInterest#L225](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L225)

```Solidity
   function compoundInterest() external whenCompoundingEnabled nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
       _updateInterest(msg.sender);
       // ... existing code
225::  rewardsReserve -= claimable;
       // ... existing code
   }
   ```

3. **Observe Rewards Reserve Reduction**:
   - The `rewardsReserve` is reduced in both cases, despite the interactions involving native tokens.

### Recommendations
- **Separate Rewards Tracking**: Implement distinct tracking for rewards in ERC20 tokens and native tokens to prevent cross-token discrepancies.
- **Conditional Reserve Management**: Adjust the logic in `_claimInterest` and `compoundInterest` to only affect `rewardsReserve` when ERC20 tokens are involved.
- **Price Oracle**: You can bring an Oracle to calculate the accurate rewards when a user calls it for their native token.

By addressing these issues, the protocol can maintain accurate rewards tracking and distribution, ensuring financial integrity and user trust.
