# Tier Boundary Race Condition in LayerEdgeStaking.sol

### Summary

Race conditions in tier boundary updates will cause permanent tier distribution invariant violations for all stakers as coordinated attackers will exploit simultaneous staking operations during tier threshold transitions to bypass the _checkBoundariesAndRecord() function's sequential processing assumptions.

The vulnerability stems from the _checkBoundariesAndRecord() function's inability to handle multiple users crossing tier boundaries simultaneously within the same block.

### Root Cause

In LayerEdgeStaking.sol:841 the _checkBoundariesAndRecord() function lacks atomic tier boundary updates when multiple users stake/unstake simultaneously, allowing the tier distribution invariants to be violated as the function calculates tier thresholds based on potentially stale stakerCountInTree values that can change between the initial calculation and the actual tier assignments.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L841

### Internal Pre-conditions



1. Multiple users need to call stake() to set stakerCountInTree to be at a tier boundary threshold (e.g., when moving from 15 to 20 stakers changes tier distribution)

2. Contract needs to have active stakers to set stakerCountInTree to be at least 1 for tier boundaries to exist

3. Multiple users need to submit staking transactions to set transaction inclusion to occur within the same block

4. Users need to stake amounts above minStakeAmount to set their isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake to be exactly true and enter the  staker tree

5. Contract state needs to be such that getTierCountForStakerCount(oldN) and getTierCountForStakerCount(n) return different tier1Count or tier2Count values when stakerCountInTree changes
 
6. The _checkBoundariesAndRecord() function needs to be called to set tier boundary updates to occur during simultaneous staking operations

7. Multiple transactions need to modify stakerCountInTree to go from value N to value N+X within the same block execution window

8. The Fenwick tree (stakerTree) needs to have users positioned near tier boundaries to set rank calculations to be affected by concurrent updates


### External preconditions

 1. Network needs to process multiple transactions in the same block to enable simultaneous tier boundary changes

 2. Gas prices need to be set appropriately across coordinated transactions to ensure same-block inclusion


### Attack Path



 1.   Attacker 1 calls stake(3000 * 1e18) when stakerCountInTree is at 15 (creating tier boundary conditions where moving to 16-20 stakers will change tier distributions)

 2.   Attacker 2 calls stake(3000 * 1e18) in the same block, triggering _checkBoundariesAndRecord(false) with oldN = 15 and n = 16

   3. Attacker 3 calls stake(3000 * 1e18) simultaneously in the same block, triggering another _checkBoundariesAndRecord(false) but now with inconsistent state where stakerCountInTree has already been modified by previous transactions

  4.  Contract executes getTierCountForStakerCount(oldN) and getTierCountForStakerCount(n) in _checkBoundariesAndRecord() at lines 1092-1095, but the oldN and n values are calculated based on different stakerCountInTree states due to concurrent modifications

   5. Contract processes tier boundary updates in loops at lines 1098-1150, calling _findAndRecordTierChange() for users who should cross tier boundaries, but the rank calculations in stakerTree.query() and _computeTierByRank() are now based on the current tree state that differs from the initial boundary calculations

   6. Contract assigns incorrect tiers to multiple users because the tier threshold calculations (new_t1, new_t2) no longer match the actual tree state after concurrent modifications

   7. Final state shows tier distribution that violates the 20/30/50 invariant (e.g., 22% in Tier 1, 28% in Tier 2, 50% in Tier 3) permanently breaking the protocol's core guarantee

   8. All subsequent stakers receive incorrect tier assignments and APY rates because the tier boundary corruption persists in the contract state


### Impact

The stakers suffer permanent tier distribution corruption affecting their APY calculations indefinitely. The protocol violates its core 20/30/50 tier distribution guarantee, causing some users to receive incorrect APY rates (higher or lower than intended) for the entire duration of their stake. Attackers do not directly gain financial value but can manipulate the system to benefit from preferential tier assignments at the expense of legitimate stakers who may be demoted to lower-paying tiers.

### Mitigation

Implement Atomic Tier Boundary Updates

The core issue is that _checkBoundariesAndRecord() processes tier boundary changes non-atomically. The function should be modified to use a locking mechanism or state snapshot approach:

```solidity
// Add a state lock to prevent concurrent boundary updates
bool private _boundaryUpdateInProgress;

modifier lockBoundaryUpdates() {
    require(!_boundaryUpdateInProgress, "Boundary update in progress");
    _boundaryUpdateInProgress = true;
    _;
    _boundaryUpdateInProgress = false;
}

function _checkBoundariesAndRecord(bool isRemoval) internal lockBoundaryUpdates {
    // Existing boundary update logic
}
```
