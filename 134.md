# Attacker will monopolize Tier allocation at the expense of honest stakers

### Summary

The lack of any Sybil resistance in the fixed size Fenwick tree will cause honest users to be permanently assigned out of Tier 1 (and potentially tier 2), as an attacker can register 20% of `MAX_USERS` minimal stake accounts to occupy all Tier 1 slots when the contract is created (or before the first user stakes).
Depending on the price of the token this attack can be cheap or expensive.

### Root Cause

The choice to implement FCFS tiering via a fixed `MAX_USERS` Fenwick tree without any Sybil resistance is a mistake, as it allows an attacker to stake from multiple addresses to control Tier 1 membership.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The attacker must generate ≥20,000,000 distinct addresses off-chain.
2. The attacker must fund each address with at least `minStakeAmount` (3000 tokens).
3. The attacker must call `stake(minStakeAmount)` from each of those addresses to become “in-tree” stakers.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. As soon as contract is created, the attacker generates ≥20,000,000 distinct addresses off-chain and funds them with at least `minStakeAmount` tokens.
2. Attacker stakes all addresses and occupy the tier 1.
3. Users can't access tier 1 anymore.

### Impact

Honest stakers cannot ever occupy a Tier 1 (or 2) slot and are forced into the lower yield Tier 3, suffering an ongoing loss of potential yield on their staked assets. The attacker alone collects the full Tier 1 reward differential.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

FCFS tiering or add KYC or other sybil attack protections.
