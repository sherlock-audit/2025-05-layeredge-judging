# Disabled Compounding Can Be Bypassed

### Summary

When `compoundingEnabled` is set to false, it disables compounding interest (i.e. stakers can't call `compoundInterest()`). Stakers can get around this by simply claiming interest and then staking their claimed interest in the same block completely defeating the purpose of disabling compounding. 

### Root Cause

Stakers can still compound interest even when compounding should be disabled.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin calls `setCompoundingStatus(false)`

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Admin disables compounding
2. Staker who has earned interest calls `claimInterest` and then `stake()` in the same block, effectively compounding. 

### Impact

Stakers can still compound interest even when compounding should be disabled.

### PoC

Add to `LayerEdgeTest.t.sol`:

```solidity
function test_CompoundingDisabledButCompoundingIsAchieved() public {
        // Alice stakes
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        token.approve(address(staking), 10000e18);
        staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
        vm.stopPrank();

        skip(7 days);

        // Admin disables compounding
        vm.prank(admin);
        staking.setCompoundingStatus(false);

        // Alice claims interest and stakes it, effectively compounding
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        uint256 oldBalance = token.balanceOf(alice);
        staking.claimInterest();
        uint256 newBalance = token.balanceOf(alice);
        staking.stake(newBalance - oldBalance);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

### Mitigation

If the goal is to block compounding interest, you'll need to likely preventing adding more staked tokens when compounding is disabled.
