# Phantom Tier Demotion on minStakeAmount Increase

### Summary

`minStakeAmount` is initialized to 3000e18, but can be changed by the owner via `setMinStakeAmount()`. 

If the owner increases the `minStakeAmount` (e.g. 4000e18), current Tier1 and Tier2 stakers who have a balance under the new minimum are not automatically demoted to Tier 3. Demotion only happens if they call unstake() on any amount greater than 0. If the system is supposed to demote these stakers, then this is a big problem, but this appears to be intended behavior.

If we assume Tier1 and Tier2 stakers who have balances under the new minimum are not demoted to Tier3, then  `getCurrentTier()` will return the incorrect tier for these stakers:
```solidity
function getCurrentTier(address userAddr) public view returns (Tier) {
...SNIP...
      // @audit Tier1 or Tier2 staker with balances under the minStakeAmount will return Tier3, even though they are Tier1 or Tier2
>>>   if (!user.isActive || (!user.isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake && user.balance < minStakeAmount)) {
            return Tier.Tier3;
        }

...SNIP...
    }
```

The LayerEdge frontend is populated using the `getAllInfoOfUser()` function, which calls `getCurrentTier` to show the user their Tier  and  `getUserAPY` which calculates the APY based on the Tier returned from `getCurrentTier`:

```solidity
function getAllInfoOfUser(address userAddr)
        external
        view
        returns (UserInfo memory user, Tier tier, uint256 apy, uint256 pendingRewards, TierEvent[] memory tierHistory)
    {
        user = users[userAddr];
>>>     tier = getCurrentTier(userAddr);
>>>     apy = getUserAPY(userAddr);
        pendingRewards = calculateUnclaimedInterest(userAddr);
        tierHistory = stakerTierHistory[userAddr];
    }
```

If Tier1 and Tier2 users see that they've been demoted to Tier 3 and are now receiving a lower APY, then there's a much higher likelihood they unstake, which can lead to a large and sudden TVL drop in the protocol. These users are also much more likely to sell the token, increasing the supply and tanking the price.  

### Root Cause

If the owner increases the `minStakeAmount`, current Tier1 and Tier2 stakers who have a balances under the new minimum will be shown as Tier 3 instead of Tier 1 or Tier 2:
```solidity
function getCurrentTier(address userAddr) public view returns (Tier) {
...SNIP...
>>>     if (!user.isActive || (!user.isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake && user.balance < minStakeAmount)) {
>>>         return Tier.Tier3;
        }
...SNIP...
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Owner needs to call `setMinStakeAmount`, increasing the `minStakeAmount`

### External Pre-conditions

n/a

### Attack Path

1. Owner increasing `minStakeAmount` because price of `stakingToken` fell
2. Tier1 and Tier2 stakers with a balance below the new `minStakeAmount` will now show as Tier3 with the Tier3 APY on the frontend. 
3. At current APYs this would make it seem like users APYs decreased 60% (Tier1 50% => Tier 2 20%) sparking a mass exit and sell off, damaging the reputation of the protocol and the price of the token.

### Impact

Incorrect information shown to users, decrease in TVL, and drop in `stakingToken` price. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In `getCurrentTier`, get the staker's current Tier using `stakerTierHistory`.
