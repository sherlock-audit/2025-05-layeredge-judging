# Bug Report: minStakeAmount â€” The Silent Stake Slayer [Medium]

**Severity:** Medium  
**Type:** Protocol Design Misconfiguration  

### ðŸ’¥ Description:  
The `setMinStakeAmount()` function allows the contract owner to set an arbitrarily high value with no upper bound.  
This can silently disable all new staking by making the required minimum stake unreachable.

**ðŸ§  Line of Code (LoC):**  
edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L334-346


### ðŸ”Ž Affected Code:
```solidity
function setMinStakeAmount(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    minStakeAmount = amount;
}
```

### ðŸ§ª Proof of Concept:
```solidity
// Malicious admin sets absurdly high minStakeAmount
staking.setMinStakeAmount(type(uint256).max);

// Now no user can stake unless they own the entire token supply
staking.stake(10000 ether); // Always fails or pushes to Tier 3
```

### ðŸ’¡ Recommendation:
```solidity
require(amount <= MAX_REASONABLE_STAKE, "Min stake too high");
```

Define `MAX_REASONABLE_STAKE` as:
```solidity
10_000_000 * 1e18;
```
