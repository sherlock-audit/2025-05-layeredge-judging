# Missing initialization of UUPSUpgradeable contract

### Summary

The `LayerEdgeStaking` contract inherits from `UUPSUpgradeable`, `OwnableUpgradeable`, `PausableUpgradeable` and `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable`, but forgets to call `__UUPSUpgradeable_init();` in its `initialize` function.

Leaving `UUPSUpgradeable` uninitialized.

### Root Cause

The root cause is that in the `initialize` function, you forget to call `__UUPSUpgradeable_init();` to properly initialize the contract.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

The impact is that if you don’t call `__UUPSUpgradeable_init()` in your upgradeable contract’s initialize function, the upgrade mechanism isn’t properly set up. This can lead to serious security risks where unauthorized parties might upgrade your contract to malicious code or disrupt the upgrade process entirely. Without this initialization, the contract’s upgrade authorization and control are effectively broken.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

It is recommended to initialize all inherited upgradable contracts. More specifically, explicitly call the `__UUPSUpgradeable_init()` function in the initialize functions to ensure all inherited modules are properly initialized. This approach aligns with standard practices for using the OpenZeppelin upgradeable pattern and helps future-proof the contract against potential changes in the underlying library.
