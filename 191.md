# Out-of-Bounds Error in Staking Function

### Summary

The staking contract allows users to register with a unique joinId that indexes into a fixed-size Fenwick Tree array sized by the constant MAX_USERS = 100,000,000. However, the contract does not enforce the maximum user cap during staking registration. This omission enables the nextJoinId counter to exceed the Fenwick Treeâ€™s maximum allowed index, causing out-of-bounds array access and potential contract reversion or denial of service.



### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking\src\stake\LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L700-L700

In the _stake internal function, when a user stakes an amount above the minimum threshold for the first time, they are assigned a joinId equal to nextJoinId which is then incremented. This joinId is used to update the Fenwick Tree:

The Fenwick Tree (stakerTree) is initialized with a fixed size based on MAX_USERS = 100,000,000. There is no check ensuring nextJoinId remains within this bound before the assignment and update call.

If the system reaches or exceeds 100 million stakers:

The call to stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1) will attempt to access or update an array index that does not exist.

This will cause a runtime out-of-bounds error, reverting the transaction.

Consequently, new staking attempts will fail, effectively halting the system's ability to accept new users.

This can lead to denial of service and loss of trust from users.



### Internal Pre-conditions

The user needs to call the stake function and deposit amount above the min and get added to the  Fenwick Tree for tracking of users address. 

### External Pre-conditions

nil

### Attack Path

Call the _stake() function 

### Impact

This can lead to denial of service and loss of trust from users.

new staking attempts will fail

### PoC

n/a

### Mitigation

The contract should enforce the user cap by adding a validation check:

`require(nextJoinId <= MAX_USERS, "Max number of stakers reached");`

before assigning joinId and updating the Fenwick Tree, thereby:

Preventing out-of-bounds array access.

Providing a clear error message to users.

Preserving contract integrity and availability.
