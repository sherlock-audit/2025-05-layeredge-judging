# Anyone can permanently lock a user's funds by causing their stakerTierHistory to grow without bound

### Summary

Before a user can do anything with their stake -- claimInterest, compoundInterest, stake, or unstake -- `_updateInterest` will be called, which calls `calculateUnclaimedInterest`.

`calculateUnclaimedInterest` contains a for loop over all tier change events.

An attacker is able to cause certain stakers to change tiers an arbitrary number of times by calling stake() and unstake() from different addresses in quick succession, including in a single transaction.

Once a staker has changed tiers enough times, they will hit an out of gas limit whenever they try to take any action on their stake. Then both their balance and interest will be locked in the contract forever.

**Note** that there is a very similar issue involving APY updates which causes the same symptom, except that it affects all stakers. While it is also an out-of-gas error in the `calculateUnclaimedInterest` code path and therefore has the same symptoms, it is ultimately a different issue. Different conditions are needed to set it up, and it stems from a different for loop over a different data structure.


### Root Cause

The root cause is the two for-loops in calculateUnclaimedInterest, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L418-L466

```solidity
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < userTierHistory.length; i++) {
            ...
        }
        ...
        for (uint256 i = relevantStartIndex + 1; i < userTierHistory.length; i++) {
             ....
        }
```

These two loops together loop over `stakerTierHistory[userAddr]`.

`stakerTierHistory[userAddr]` is unbounded in length. A new tier event is added every time a staker is added and removed from the tree. This allows an attacker to manipulate the stakerTierHistory for a target user so that this loop exceeds the gas limit.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Targeted staker must be on the boundary between tiers

However, note that, by adding enough new stakers, an attacker can move the boundary between tiers at will, and thus target any tier 2 or tier 3 staker in the tree. An attacker who controls a number of early staking addresses will even be able to target tier 1 stakers.

Note that there is another unbounded for loop in _updateInterest, in getTierAPYForPeriod, which is called from inside the loop of calculateUnclaimedInterest. This can brick the user's stake independently. But the effects are multiplicative: the more times the APY has been changed, the viewer tier events need be created to brick a user's stake.

### External Pre-conditions

None really.

But note that performing this attack requires that the attacker lock an amount of token for a 1 week period, equal to number of tier change events needed * MIN_STAKE / 2. At the default MIN_STAKE of 3000, and with the current price of EDGEN at about  $0.000002 ( https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/pools/0x0132c828e339cbe06d390635c9bd396517d99fda ), this is actually quite cheap.

### Attack Path

1. Bob stakes, and becomes tier 2
2. An attacker adds stakers from enough addresses so that Bob is now on the boundary between tier 1 and tier 2
3. The attacker repeats the following some number of times, within a single transaction or short succession of transactions
   a. Add a new staker meeting the minimum stake threshold. This causes the number of tier 1 stakers to increase by 1, and causes Bob to move to tier 1, with a tier change event added
   b. Immediately unstake that staker. This causes Bob to regress back to tier 2, and another tier change to be added
4. Bob will now get an out-of-gas error any time he attempts to unstake, stake, claimInterest, or compoundInterest.
5. Therefore, Bob's stake -- both balance and interest -- are locked forever.

### Impact

Users can have their stake locked in the contract forever.

### PoC

Add this to TierBoundaryAndInterestTest.t.sol. Bob's call to unstake will fail with an out-of-gas error.  Changing the number 1478 to 1477 will cause it to succeed. This is for 8000000 gas to be allocated to the call to unstake; obviously it will need to be higher to exceed the current Ethereum gas per block limit of 36M.

I have played around with the parameters, including adding a vm.warp() between calls to stake and unstake (then only 1424 iterations of the loop are needed to cause an out-of-gas error) and combining with admin calls to updateAllAPYs (effect is much smaller than anticipated, even though I confirmed with printouts that the total gas consumption is O(number of APY changes * number of tier changes)). Ultimately, they do not matter for the validity of this issue.

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < initialStakers.length; i++) {
            vm.startPrank(initialStakers[i]);
            token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE);
            staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
            vm.stopPrank();
        }

        // Create many additional addresses that stake and unstake immediately

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < 1478; i++) {
            address quickStaker = makeAddr(string(abi.encodePacked("quickStaker", i)));
            dealToken(quickStaker, MIN_STAKE);
            
            // Stake
            vm.startPrank(quickStaker);

            // Unstake immediately
            staking.unstake(MIN_STAKE);
            vm.stopPrank();
        }

        // Check tier counts after all operations
        (uint256 tier1Count, uint256 tier2Count, uint256 tier3Count) = staking.getTierCounts();
        
        // With 5 active stakers:
        // Tier 1: 20% = 1 staker
        // Tier 2: 30% = 1 staker
        // Tier 3: 50% = 3 stakers
        assertEq(tier1Count, 1, "Should have 1 tier 1 staker");
        assertEq(tier2Count, 1, "Should have 1 tier 2 staker");
        assertEq(tier3Count, 4, "Should have 4 tier 3 stakers");

        // Check Bob's tier before unstaking
        LayerEdgeStaking.Tier bobTierBefore = staking.getCurrentTier(bob);
        
        // Bob attempts to unstake
        vm.startPrank(bob);
        staking.unstake{gas: 8000000}(MIN_STAKE);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
