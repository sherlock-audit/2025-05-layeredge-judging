# A malicious user can drain the contract by manipulating the function claimInterestNative

### Summary

The contract does not account what the user has staked (edgen) or native eth - as mentioned in the readme - On Ethereum, we use EDGEN
- in the function claimInterestNative the claimable is set to the interest earned and not actually checked if the interest that is earned is either on edgen or native eth so a malicious user can stake the lower value(edgen) and gain interest on more valued token (eth)


### Root Cause

the root cause stems from the function claiminterestnative - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L783
where you can see it sets the claimable to the interest.earned and if its the native path it transfers the native token rather then the lower valued edgen that the user actually staked

### Internal Pre-conditions

normal protocol conditions

### External Pre-conditions

normal protocol conditions

### Attack Path

for this attack assume a malicious user named alice - 
1) alice first stakes for eg take 3000 edgen and assume shes in tier 1 
2) assume she staked her tokens for 1 month and remained in tier 1 for that time in calculation she got 1.233e20 / 1e18 = 123.3 tokens
3) now she wants to claim so in principal she should get 123 tokens but she used the function - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L206
4) now rather then 123 edgen token she will get 123 ether

### Impact

Major fund loss of the protocol profit of thousands of dollars 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

have different accounting for native claim
