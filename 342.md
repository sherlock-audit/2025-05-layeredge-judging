# Sybil staker will monopolise high-yield tiers and dilute returns for honest users

### Summary

Counting tier seats by address instead of staked balance plus no Sybil-resistance will cause unfair APY allocation to honest stakers as a single actor splits capital into many `minStakeAmount` wallets and controls a disproportionate share of Tier-1 / Tier-2 seats.  
Two concrete attack patterns exist:

* Profit attack – stake a large “main” wallet first, then flood the tree with minimum-stake wallets so the main wallet is pushed into a higher tier.
* Grief attack – flood only minimum-stake wallets early, occupying Tier-1/Tier-2 seats and pushing all honest users into lower tiers.

### Root Cause

- In [LayerEdgeStaking._stake()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L674-L723) every new EOA with `amount ≥ minStakeAmount` increments the Fenwick tree by **+1**, permanently fixing its rank, regardless of stake size.  
- In [getTierCountForStakerCount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L480-L509) tier quotas are `⌊0.20 × N⌋` and `⌊0.30 × N⌋`, purely address-count based.  
  There is no per-address cool-down, Sybil detection, or weighting by stake.

### Attack Path

Profit variant (numbers: `minStakeAmount = 100`, 20 honest users already staked):

1. EOA-A stakes 47.000 tokens first (rank 21).  
2. Attacker stakes 30 EOAs (`B₁…B₃₀`) with 100 tokens each.  
3. Population grows to 51; Tier-1 seats = `⌊0.20×51⌋ = 10`, Tier-2 seats = 15.  
4. EOA-A rank 21 is now in Tier-2 (35 % APY) instead of Tier-3 (20 %).  
5. Late honest user joins at rank 52, still Tier-3.

*Grief variant*:

1. No main wallet; attacker stakes K = 50 Sybil wallets early.  
2. Honest users arriving later begin at rank K+1, immediately placed in lower tiers until the population exceeds the Sybil block.


### Impact

* Profit attack: Attacker’s blended APY on 50 000 tokens rises from 20 % → ≈ 34 % (≈ +7 100 tokens / year).  
* Grief attack: Honest stakers lose up to 15 percentage-points APY (35 % → 20 %) until ~50 additional real users join.  
Gas cost for Sybil wallets is negligible relative to the gained yield; attacker bears no capital opportunity loss because the stake would have been locked anyway.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

* Enforce a per-EOA cool-down (e.g., one first-stake per block).  
* Weight tier ranking by staked balance, not address count.  
* Impose a cap on the number of Tier-1 / Tier-2 seats controlled by the same `tx.origin` or KYC identity.  
* Introduce staking fees that scale with the number of addresses funded by the same depositor to dis-incentivise Sybil flooding.
