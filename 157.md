# Missing Precision Multiplication in `LayerEdgeStaking.sol:updateAllAPYs()`

### Summary


The `updateAllAPYs()` function in `LayerEdgeStaking.sol` sets tier APY values directly without applying the expected precision factor (`PRECISION = 1e18`):

```solidity
function updateAllAPYs(uint256 _tier1APY, uint256 _tier2APY, uint256 _tier3APY) external onlyOwner {
    tier1APY = _tier1APY;
    tier2APY = _tier2APY;
    tier3APY = _tier3APY;
    ...
}
```

However, elsewhere in the contract, APY values are expected to be stored in fixed-point format (i.e. multiplied by `PRECISION`) for accurate interest calculation. Failing to do so here leads to inconsistent APY scaling, causing either:

* Near-zero rewards (if raw integers like `50` are passed)
* Extremely inflated rewards (if values like `50 * 1e18 * 1e18` are passed)



### Root Cause

The function fails to normalize incoming APY values by multiplying them with the contract's global `PRECISION` constant, which is required for all internal interest computations.


### Internal Pre-conditions

* Interest calculation functions assume all tier APY values are scaled by `PRECISION` (`1e18`).
* These scaled APYs are used in the formula:

```solidity
interest = (balance * apy * timeElapsed) / (SECONDS_IN_YEAR * PRECISION * 100);
```

### External Pre-conditions

* An externally owned account (EOA) or multisig with `onlyOwner` privilege calls `updateAllAPYs()` and passes raw APY values (e.g. `50`, `35`, `20`) without applying `PRECISION`.


### Attack Path

This is primarily a **misconfiguration risk**, but it can be exploited in the following way:

1. A malicious or careless owner sets unscaled APYs (`updateAllAPYs(50, 35, 20)`).
2. The APY values get saved as `50`, `35`, and `20` (instead of `50e18`, `35e18`, etc.).
3. When users claim rewards, interest computed is effectively \~0 (since APY is tiny compared to `PRECISION`-scaled formulas).
4. Users receive far less than they should, breaking reward promises and potentially causing damage to protocol reputation and trust.

Alternatively:

* Owner passes already scaled values (like `50e18`), but if the code *also* multiplies these, it leads to `50e36`, causing huge overflows or misbehavior in reward logic.


### Impact

* **Incorrect interest calculations**, leading to potential reward overflows or underflows
* **Protocol-wide misbehavior** if the owner sets APYs using unscaled inputs
* **Potential loss of funds** if users receive inflated interest they shouldnâ€™t



### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Apply precision scaling within the function:

```solidity
tier1APY = _tier1APY * PRECISION;
tier2APY = _tier2APY * PRECISION;
tier3APY = _tier3APY * PRECISION;
```

Alternatively, enforce that input values are pre-scaled and **validate** with:

```solidity
require(_tier1APY <= 100 * PRECISION, "Unrealistic APY");
require(_tier1APY % PRECISION == 0, "APY must be scaled");
```
