# Race Condition in unstake and setMinStakeAmount Leading to Unfair User Tier Demotion

### Summary

Affected line of code: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#740

The LayerEdgeStaking contract, intended for deployment on the Ethereum mainnet, contains a race condition vulnerability where a user’s unstake transaction and the owner’s setMinStakeAmount transaction are executed in the same block which could result in the user being unfairly demoted. 

Specifically, if a user unstakes an amount that would keep their balance above the previous minStakeAmount, but setMinStakeAmount increases the threshold first within the same block, the user’s new balance may fall below the updated minStakeAmount leading to a permanent demotion.

### Root Cause

Using the current minStakeAmount for demotion rather than the minStakeAmount at the time of unstaking.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Owner needs to call setMinStakeAmount to a value higher than its previous value.

### External Pre-conditions

_

### Attack Path

1. User unstakes an amount that would normally keep his stake balance >= minStakeAmount
2. Owner callls setMinStakeAmount to a value greater than the previous minStakeAmount
3. The owner's transaction is ordered before the user's unstaking (Highly possible on ETH mainnet)
4. The new and higher minStakeAmount  causes this line: ``` if (!user.outOfTree && user.balance < minStakeAmount) ``` to return true which leads to the user being unfairly removed from tree

### Impact

Affected users are permanently demoted to Tier 3, reducing their APY and causing significant reward losses over time.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

One solution is to add a grace period (possibly 1 block) after changing minStakeAmount before enforcing it.
