# Extended Unstaking Window in LayerEdgeStaking Contract

### Summary

The LayerEdgeStaking contract implements an unstaking window that adds an additional 7 days to any staking period. This means users must wait longer than intended to access their funds, as the unstaking window is added on top of their staking period rather than being part of it. For example, to earn 7 days of interest, users must commit to a total of 14 days (7 days staking + 7 days unstaking window).


### Root Cause

The `unstaking` window is implemented as an additional period after the `unstake` request, rather than being integrated into the staking period:

### Internal Pre-conditions

Contract must have a 7-day unstaking window (UNSTAKE_WINDOW = 7 days)
User must have staked tokens
User must have sufficient balance to unstake

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

#### Extended Commitment Required:

1.  User stakes tokens
2. Waits desired staking period (n days)
3. Submits unstake request
4. Must wait additional 7 days
5. Total commitment: n + 7 days

#### Interest Rate Impact:

1. User stakes in Tier 1 (highest APY)
2. Waits 7 days for interest
3. Queues unstake
4. Must wait another 7 days
5. Total time: 14 days for 7 days of interest

### Impact

Financial Impact: Users must commit to longer periods than intended

System Integrity: Mismatch between intended and actual staking periods

### PoC

```solidity 

function testExtendedUnstakingWindow() public {
        // Setup
        uint256 stakeAmount = MIN_STAKE;

        address bereket = makeAddr("bereket");
        vm.prank(admin);
        token.transfer(bereket, MIN_STAKE * 10);
        
        vm.startPrank(bereket);
        token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE * 10);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Stake tokens
        vm.startPrank(bereket);
        staking.stake(stakeAmount);
        
        // Wait 7 days for interest
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 7 days);
        
        // Queue unstake
        staking.unstake(stakeAmount);
        
        // Get unstake request
        (uint256 amount, uint256 timestamp, bool completed) = staking.unstakeRequests(bereket, 0);
        
        // Must wait another 7 days
        vm.warp(timestamp + UNSTAKE_WINDOW - 1);
        
        // Try to complete unstake (should fail)
        vm.expectRevert("Unstaking window not reached");
        staking.completeUnstake(0);
        
        // Advance time past unstaking window
        vm.warp(timestamp + UNSTAKE_WINDOW + 1);
        
        // Complete unstake (should succeed)
        staking.completeUnstake(0);
        
    }

```

### Mitigation

Implement a dynamic unstaking window that considers the staking duration:

```solidity
function _unstake(uint256 amount, address userAddr) internal {
    UserInfo storage user = users[userAddr];
    uint256 stakingDuration = block.timestamp - user.lastClaimTime;
    
    // Calculate remaining required time
    uint256 remainingWindow = stakingDuration < UNSTAKE_WINDOW ? 
        UNSTAKE_WINDOW - stakingDuration : 0;
    
    unstakeRequests[userAddr].push(UnstakeRequest({
        amount: amount,
        timestamp: block.timestamp,
        requiredWait: remainingWindow,
        completed: false
    }));
}

```
