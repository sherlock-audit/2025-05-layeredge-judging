# Tier History Griefing: Unbounded Tier Events Cause DoS Risk on calculateUnclaimedInterest

### Summary

An attacker can artificially inflate the `stakerTierHistory `of other stakers by repeatedly triggering tier boundary changes through `stake()` and `unstake()` operations. Because `calculateUnclaimedInterest()` loops through this array to compute interest, this creates a **griefing vector** that increases gas cost for others. In the worst case, this could lead to **denial of service (DoS)** for stakers with a bloated tier history, especially since `_updateInterest()` (which calls `calculateUnclaimedInterest`) is invoked at the beginning of all major staking actions.

### Root Cause

The core issue lies in the design of the `calculateUnclaimedInterest `function:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L419

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L451

This array is looped over entirely to compute interest. However, `stake()` and `unstake()` by **any** user can trigger `_checkBoundariesAndRecord`, which may update the **tier of other users** (at tier boundaries), appending new entries to their `stakerTierHistory`.

This coupling allows an attacker to manipulate many users’ histories without interacting with them or requiring their consent.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Attacker `Judy `performs repeated `stake()`/`unstake()` cycles of the minimum stake amount.
2. Each cycle triggers tier boundary updates that affect users like `Bob`, `David`, and `Eve`.
3. Each affected user gets **2 new entries** per attacker cycle.
4. Once enough cycles are performed, these users’ **stakerTierHistory** arrays become massive.
5. Any action they take (even `stake()`, `unstake()`, `claimInterest()`, ) will call `_updateInterest()` → `calculateUnclaimedInterest()` → O(n) loop.
6. At a certain history size, their actions will **run out of gas**, effectively freezing their account — **permanent DoS** unless they upgrade contracts.

### Impact

**High gas griefing:** Users pay increasingly higher gas for every action due to bloated tier history.
**Permanent DoS:** At large enough tier history sizes, users can no longer interact with the contract.
**No cost to attacker:** Attacker can recover all funds at the end (stake → unstake → completeUnstake), incurring **no loss**.
