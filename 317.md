# DoS on Tier Boundary Updates Can Permanently Brick Core Staking Functions

### Summary

The `_checkBoundariesAndRecord` function contains unbounded loops that can cause out-of-gas errors, permanently disabling critical staking functions. When the number of active stakers changes (users joining/leaving the Fenwick tree), the function attempts to update tier assignments for all affected users in a single transaction, which can exceed block gas limits and cause permanent DoS of staking and unstaking functionality.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in the unbounded loops within _checkBoundariesAndRecord function 
```javascript

for (uint256 rank = old_t1 + 1; rank <= new_t1; rank++) {
    _findAndRecordTierChange(rank, n);
}
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L856

Each `_findAndRecordTierChange` call performs expensive operations:

1. Tree traversal: stakerTree.findByCumulativeFrequency(rank) (~1,000-3,000 gas)
2. Additional tree query: stakerTree.query(joinIdCross) (~1,000-3,000 gas)
3. Storage writes in _recordTierChange() (~20,000 gas)
4. Total per iteration: ~25,000 gas
5. With Ethereum's ~30M gas block limit, processing ~1,200 users would cause out-of-gas errors.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A large number of users (1,000+) have staked amounts ≥ minStakeAmount and are active in the Fenwick tree
2. stakerCountInTree reaches a size where tier boundary shifts affect many users
3. Tier percentages are configured as: Tier 1 (20%), Tier 2 (30%), Tier 3 (50%)
4. The contract has been operating normally with gradual user growth

### External Pre-conditions

1. This can happen naturally during normal protocol usage:
* A user stakes for the first time with amount ≥ minStakeAmount (triggers _checkBoundariesAndRecord(false)) 
* A user unstakes bringing their balance below minStakeAmount (triggers _checkBoundariesAndRecord(true))
2. Mass unstaking events during market downturns
3. Ethereum gas limits remain at current levels (~30M gas per block)

### Attack Path

1. Setup Phase (Natural Growth):
1,000+ users stake amounts ≥ minStakeAmount over time through normal protocol usage
Each user gets added to the Fenwick tree with stakerCountInTree++
Users are assigned tier positions based on their join order (FCFS)
Trigger Event (Natural Scenario):

2. Scenario A: A new user stakes ≥ minStakeAmount for the first time
Calls _stake() → _checkBoundariesAndRecord(false)
Scenario B: An existing user unstakes, bringing balance below minStakeAmount
Calls _unstake() → _checkBoundariesAndRecord(true)

3. DoS Execution:
`_checkBoundariesAndRecord` calculates tier boundary changes
Function attempts to update tier assignments for hundreds/thousands of users in loops
Transaction runs out of gas due to unbounded iterations
All subsequent staking/unstaking operations fail with the same out-of-gas error

4. Permanent Protocol Failure:
New staking becomes impossible for users meeting minimum requirements
Unstaking below minimum threshold becomes impossible
Contract enters permanently broken state with no recovery mechanism

### Impact

Critical Protocol Failure: Core staking functionality becomes permanently unusable

### PoC

```javascript
function test_DoS_BoundaryUpdate() public {
    // Setup: Create many minimum stakers
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        address user = address(uint160(i + 1000));
        deal(address(token), user, MIN_STAKE);
        
        vm.startPrank(user);
        token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE);
        staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
    
    // Attack: Unstake to trigger large boundary shift
    vm.startPrank(alice);
    // This will call _checkBoundariesAndRecord with large tier shifts
    vm.expectRevert(); // Out of gas
    staking.unstake(MIN_STAKE);
    vm.stopPrank();
}


```

### Mitigation

Batch Processing with Gas Limits


```javascript

uint256 public constant MAX_BOUNDARY_UPDATES_PER_TX = 50;
mapping(bytes32 => BoundaryUpdateState) public pendingBoundaryUpdates;

struct BoundaryUpdateState {
    uint256 startRank;
    uint256 endRank;
    uint256 currentRank;
    bool isActive;
    bool isRemoval;
}

function _checkBoundariesAndRecord(bool isRemoval) internal {
    // Calculate boundaries...
    
    if (new_t1 != old_t1) {
        uint256 updatesNeeded = new_t1 > old_t1 ? new_t1 - old_t1 : old_t1 - new_t1;
        
        if (updatesNeeded <= MAX_BOUNDARY_UPDATES_PER_TX) {
            // Process immediately if small
            _processBoundaryUpdates(startRank, endRank);
        } else {
            // Store for batch processing
            bytes32 updateId = keccak256(abi.encode(startRank, endRank, block.timestamp));
            pendingBoundaryUpdates[updateId] = BoundaryUpdateState({
                startRank: startRank,
                endRank: endRank,
                currentRank: startRank,
                isActive: true,
                isRemoval: isRemoval
            });
        }
    }
}

function processPendingBoundaryUpdates(bytes32 updateId) external {
    BoundaryUpdateState storage state = pendingBoundaryUpdates[updateId];
    require(state.isActive, "No pending updates");
    
    uint256 processed = 0;
    while (state.currentRank <= state.endRank && processed < MAX_BOUNDARY_UPDATES_PER_TX) {
        _findAndRecordTierChange(state.currentRank, stakerCountInTree);
        state.currentRank++;
        processed++;
    }
    
    if (state.currentRank > state.endRank) {
        state.isActive = false;
    }
}
```
