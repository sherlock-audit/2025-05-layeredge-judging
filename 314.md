# Lack of cooldown in `LayerEdgeStaking::compoundInterest` would lead to unfair reward drain and race condition.

### Summary

The [`LayerEdgeStaking::compoundInterest`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L213) lacks a cooldown mechanism, which would lead to frequent calling in order to maximise gains, which would lead to unfair reward distribution.

### Root Cause

The [`LayerEdgeStaking::compoundInterest`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L213) is used by users to increase their stakes in order to increase their APY as a whole:
```solidity
 function compoundInterest() external whenCompoundingEnabled nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        _updateInterest(msg.sender);

        UserInfo storage user = users[msg.sender];
        uint256 claimable = user.interestEarned;

        require(claimable > 0, "Nothing to compound");

        // Check if we have enough rewards in the contract
        require(rewardsReserve >= claimable, "Insufficient rewards in contract");

        // Update rewards reserve
        rewardsReserve -= claimable;
       . . . 
}
```
However, as we can observe there is no mechanism that prevents frequent calling of this function, which would immediately increase the stake of the users and bots could severely spam in order to maximise rewards.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to enable the compounding via `setCompoundingStatus`.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Users / bots can simply spam the [`LayerEdgeStaking::compoundInterest`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L213) in order to maximise gains.

### Impact

1. Unfair to the normal users as they cannot compound rapidly leading to loss of funds.
2. Unwanted MEV opportunity.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

A common implementation observed across different protocols is to simply add a duration based cooldown ( 24 hours preferably ).
