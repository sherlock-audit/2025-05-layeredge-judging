# Allowance frontrunning results in tokens being stolen

## Allowance frontrunning results in tokens being stolen

### Summary

When the allowance of an user is being changed, that user can frontrun the transaction to spend both the old and the new allowance, resulting in way more tokens being spent than intended.

### Vulnerability Detail
Instead of being able to increase or decrease the approval amount, an user can only directly change it which results in the following frontrunning vulnerability:

1. Alice is approved to use 6 tokens on behalf of Bob.
2. Bob decides to change Alice's allowance to 8 by calling the `approve` function.
3. Alice sees Bob's transaction and creates a transaction, spending 6 of Bob's tokens (by calling the `transferFrom` function).
4. Alice's transaction gets executed first, transferring the tokens and setting the allowance to 0.
5. Immediately after that, Bob's transaction gets executed and the allowance gets set to 8.
6. Alice can now spend another 8 of Bob's tokens (spending a total of 14 tokens) even though these weren't Bob's intentions.


### Impact
An user can spend more tokens than they are allowed on behalf of another user.

### Code Snippet

```solidity
    function approve(address guy, uint256 wad) public returns (bool) {
        allowance[msg.sender][guy] = wad;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, guy, wad);
        return true;
    }
```

### Tool used
Manual Review

### Recommendation
Instead of directly changing the approval through the `approve` function, consider implementing `increaseAllowance` and `decreaseAllowance` functions
