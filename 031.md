# Unsafe Casting in FenwickTree.update() Can Corrupt Tree Data and Break Cumulative Sum Logic

### Summary

Casting a potentially large uint256 value to int256 in FenwickTree.update() will cause arithmetic corruption or transaction reverts for any contract relying on the Fenwick Tree, as any actor who triggers an update when the stored value ≥ 2²⁵⁵ will cause integer overflow and break the cumulative frequency tree logic.

Example of the overflow
Suppose:

uint256 largeValue = 2**255; // 2^255, exactly the midpoint

int256 castedValue = int256(largeValue); // Unsafe cast
castedValue will no longer be positive 2^255, but instead:


castedValue == -2^255   // A large negative number

### Root Cause

In [FenwickTree.sol](https://github.com/Layer-Edge/edgen-staking/blob/main/src/FenwickTree.sol):9, the update() function performs an unsafe cast of uint256 to int256 when applying the update delta:

self.data[index] = uint256(int256(self.data[index]) + delta);

If self.data[index] is greater than or equal to 2^255, this cast overflows the signed integer range, resulting in a negative number and causing the addition with delta to yield incorrect results. When the final result is cast back to uint256, it becomes an extremely large (but invalid) number, corrupting the Fenwick tree.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Any user or system must trigger update() on the tree using a target index.

self.data[index] must be ≥ 2²⁵⁵ before casting (this could occur over time as values accumulate).

delta must be a nonzero value to initiate a change.



### External Pre-conditions

External contracts or users must be interacting with systems (e.g., staking, voting, reward distribution) that rely on this Fenwick tree.

No external guards exist to prevent large values from being accumulated in the tree.

Total value flow through the system must be unbounded or unbounded enough to eventually hit 2^255.



### Attack Path

Over time, repeated updates or deposits increase self.data[index] to ≥ 2^255.

A user (honest or malicious) calls update() on that index with any delta (positive or negative).

The line int256(self.data[index]) silently overflows, wrapping the value into a large negative signed integer.

The signed addition may either:

Trigger a runtime revert (e.g., int256.min + (-1)), or

Produce a valid-but-wrong result (if no overflow occurs), leading to silent tree corruption.

The corrupted value is cast back to uint256, introducing a massive, incorrect number into the tree.

Any later query() or findByCumulativeFrequency() will yield wrong answers, possibly breaking logic that depends on prefix sums (e.g., tiered staking levels, voting weights, reward levels).

The corruption can propagate silently, affecting all tree queries and dependent contract logic.

### Impact

The entire Fenwick Tree logic becomes unreliable and unusable. Specifically:

Contracts depending on this structure (e.g., LayerEdgeStaking) will produce incorrect results when determining ranks, cumulative values, or frequency thresholds.

The bug can cause loss of user rewards, incorrect staking tiers, voting power miscalculations, or DoS of systems relying on this data structure.

The system may experience transaction reverts if invalid arithmetic occurs, locking up funds or halting critical flows.

This bug is critical due to the potential for both silent state corruption and runtime reverts that impact correctness and liveness.

### PoC

contract Exploit {
    using FenwickTree for FenwickTree.Tree;

    FenwickTree.Tree private tree;

    function breakTree() public {
        tree.size = 1;
        // Manually inject a large value
        tree.data[1] = 2 ** 255;

        // Attempting to update it will break the logic
        tree.update(1, 1); // This will revert or corrupt data
    }
}


### Mitigation

Replace the unsafe casting with a fully safe conversion and range check:


function update(Tree storage self, uint256 index, int256 delta) internal {
    require(index > 0, "Index must be > 0");

    while (index <= self.size) {
        int256 current = int256(self.data[index]);
        int256 updated = current + delta;
        require(updated >= 0, "Update underflowed below zero");

        self.data[index] = uint256(updated);
        index += lsb(index);
    }
}
Bonus: Add a check to reject values ≥ 2²⁵⁵ if you don't expect them in practice:


require(self.data[index] < 2**255, "Unsafe value range");
