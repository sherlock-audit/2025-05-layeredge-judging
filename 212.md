# Setting `minStakeAmount` to a higher value may result in the user losing 15 to 30% of APY.

### Summary

Setting `minStakeAmount` to a higher value may result in the user losing 15 to 30% of APY.

### Root Cause

In [`LayerEdgeStaking:334-336`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L334-L336) `setMinStakeAmount` function allows to immediately change the value of `minStakeAmount`, which can lead to users being permanently downgraded to Tier 3. Although the function is only available to the owner, the owner is not aware of the consequences of this action.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User staked more than `minStakeAmount`.
2. Owner sets `minStakeAmount` to a higher value.
3. At the same time, user calls `unstake(amount)` where `staked - new minStakeAmount` < `amount` < `staked - old minStakeAmount`

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Users are permanently downgraded to Tier 3, which results in a loss of 15 to 30% APY (with Default APY values) depending on whether they were previously in Tier 1 or Tier 2.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

As an option, it is possible to allow increasing the `minStakeAmount` value only during a pause.
