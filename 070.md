# Signed Integer Underflow in update() Enables Permanent Tier Manipulation

### Summary

A signed integer underflow in the update() function when casting negative deltas to uint256 will cause a permanent corruption of tree data and disruption of prefix sum calculations for protocols and users relying on accurate tree operations as an attacker will supply a large negative delta to cause underflow and manipulate tree values.

### Root Cause

In FenwickTree.sol, the root cause is a mistake in the code. In the update() function (lines 10–12), the code uses unchecked arithmetic by casting a potentially negative result to uint256, which will cause an underflow if int256(self.data[index]) + delta is negative. This corrupts the tree’s data structure and disrupts all subsequent prefix sum calculations

### Internal Pre-conditions



  1.  Attacker needs to call update() to supply a delta that is negative and has an absolute value greater than the target node's current value.

  2.  Target node's value (self.data[index]) must be less than the absolute value of the supplied negative delta (e.g., node value = 100, delta = -101).

  3.  Contract code must lack a check to ensure int256(self.data[index]) + delta is non-negative before casting to uint256 (no require(newValue >= 0)).

   4. Fenwick tree must have a size initialized to a value ≥ target index to allow the update loop to execute.

These conditions enable the underflow, corrupting the tree's data structure

### External Pre-conditions

No external protocol or oracle dependency is required for the underflow attack to succeed, as the vulnerability is entirely self-contained within the Fenwick tree logic and its inputs

### Attack Path



    1. Attacker calls update() with a target index and a negative delta
    The attacker selects a specific index in the Fenwick tree and supplies a negative delta whose absolute value exceeds the current value at that index.

    2. The function adds the negative delta to the node’s value
    Inside the update() function, the code performs int256(self.data[index]) + delta, which results in a negative value if the delta is sufficiently negative.

    3. The negative result is cast to uint256, causing underflow
    The negative result is then cast to uint256, which wraps around to a very large positive number (approximately 2256−12256−1), corrupting the node’s value.

    4. The corrupted value is propagated through the tree
    The update loop continues to propagate this corrupted value to all affected parent nodes in the Fenwick tree, as required by the tree’s update logic.

    5. Tree operations become unreliable
    Subsequent calls to query() or findByCumulativeFrequency() will return incorrect results due to the corrupted node values, potentially breaking protocol logic that depends on accurate prefix sums or frequency lookups.


### Impact

The protocol and users relying on accurate Fenwick tree operations suffer a permanent corruption of tree data and disruption of prefix sum calculations. This means that any logic or state depending on Fenwick tree queries—such as tiering, allocations, or frequency lookups—will produce incorrect results. The attacker may not directly gain assets, but can manipulate protocol logic to their advantage or cause denial of service by breaking essential features.

### PoC

```solidity
function test_underflow_exploit() public {
        // Verify initial value
        uint256 initialValue = tree.data[1];
        assertEq(initialValue, 100);

        // Attempt to trigger underflow by applying a large negative delta
        tree.update(1, -101); // 100 - 101 = -1, which underflows to uint256.max

        // Check the corrupted value
        uint256 corruptedValue = tree.data[1];
        assertEq(corruptedValue, type(uint256).max, "Node value should underflow to uint256.max");
    }
```

### Mitigation

Check for Negative Results Before Casting:
Before performing the cast from int256 to uint256, ensure that the result of the arithmetic operation is non-negative. If it is negative, revert the transaction to prevent underflow and data corruption

Update the update() Function:
Modify the function to include a check that prevents negative values from being cast to uint256:
```solidity
function update(Tree storage self, uint256 index, int256 delta) internal {
    require(index > 0, "Index must be > 0");

    uint256 current = self.data[index];
    int256 newValue = int256(current) + delta;
    require(newValue >= 0, "Underflow protection"); // Prevents negative values

    while (index <= self.size) {
        self.data[index] = uint256(newValue);
        index += lsb(index);
    }
}
```
