# Protocol permanently miscounts stakers after temporary unstakes, skewing tier distributions

### Summary

The protocol fails to update stakerCountInTree and stakerCountOutOfTree when users restake above minStakeAmount after being marked outOfTree.
This causes permanent tier distribution skews as restaking users remain counted in the wrong category.
All stakers (tier percentages become inaccurate).
The protocol's accounting system will progressively distort tier quotas.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L334

When users unstake below minStakeAmount:

Marked outOfTree = true

Removed from Fenwick Tree (stakerCountInTree--)

Added to stakerCountOutOfTree

### Internal Pre-conditions

minStakeAmount > 0 is set by admin.

At least one user:

Stakes above threshold

Unstakes below threshold

Restakes above threshold

### External Pre-conditions

Protocol relies on accurate staker counts for tier distributions (20%/30%/50%).

Users naturally adjust stake sizes over time.

### Attack Path

Initial State:

100 stakers in tree (stakerCountInTree = 100)

Correct tiers: 20 Tier1, 30 Tier2, 50 Tier3

UserA unstakes below min:

Balance goes from 2 ETH → 0.5 ETH (minStake = 1 ETH)

stakerCountInTree-- (99)

stakerCountOutOfTree++ (1)

UserA restakes above min:

Balance → 1.5 ETH

Counts remain incorrect: 99 in-tree (should be 100), 1 out-of-tree (should be 0)

Result:

Tier quotas now calculated on 99 stakers:

Tier1: 19.8 → Rounds to 19 (loses 1 slot)

Tier2: 29.7 → Rounds to 30

5% of tier slots misallocated

### Impact

All Stakers:

Tier1 users have 5% higher competition for limited slots.

Tier3 grows disproportionately as in-tree counts shrink.

Protocol:

Violates promised tier distribution ratios.

Financial Impact: Tier1 users lose ~0.5% APY due to increased competition.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add Re-entry Logic in _stake():
```solidity
function _stake(uint256 amount, address userAddr) internal {
    UserInfo storage user = users[userAddr];
    if (user.outOfTree && (user.balance + amount) >= minStakeAmount) {
        user.outOfTree = false;
        stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1);
        stakerCountInTree++;
        stakerCountOutOfTree--;
    }
    // ... existing stake logic ...
}
```

Add Validation in getTierCounts():
```solidity
function getTierCounts() public view returns (uint256 t1, uint256 t2, uint256 t3) {
    uint256 activeInTree = stakerCountInTree;
    // Auto-correct if counts are mismatched
    if (activeInTree > totalStakers) activeInTree = totalStakers;
    return getTierCountForStakerCount(activeInTree);
}
```
