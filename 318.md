# LayerEdge Staking Gas Exhaustion via Cascading Tier Updates"

### Summary

The LayerEdge staking protocol suffers from a gas DoS vulnerability where each stake/unstake operation triggers O(k × log n) gas complexity, where k is the number of users affected by tier boundary changes (typically 1-20 users, up to ~50 in extreme cases) and n is the total number of stakers. As the protocol scales, individual transactions become prohibitively expensive, making the protocol economically unviable at scale.


### Root Cause


The vulnerability stems from the `_checkBoundariesAndRecord()` function that is called on every stake/unstake operation. This function:

1. Recalculates tier boundaries for the entire protocol
2. Loops through affected rank ranges when **tier boundary counts change**
3. Updates multiple users' tiers in a single transaction via `_findAndRecordTierChange()`
4. Performs expensive tree operations (O(log n)) for each affected user

```solidity
function _checkBoundariesAndRecord(bool isRemoval) internal {
    // Recalculate thresholds for entire protocol
    (uint256 old_t1, uint256 old_t2,,) = getTierCountForStakerCount(oldN);
    (uint256 new_t1, uint256 new_t2,,) = getTierCountForStakerCount(n);

    // Loop through users affected by BOUNDARY CHANGES only
    if (new_t1 != old_t1) {
        if (new_t1 > old_t1) {
            // Promotion: users from old_t1+1 to new_t1 get promoted to Tier 1
            for (uint256 rank = old_t1 + 1; rank <= new_t1; rank++) {
                _findAndRecordTierChange(rank, n);  // O(log n) per iteration
            }
        } else {
            // Demotion: users from new_t1+1 to old_t1 get demoted from Tier 1
            for (uint256 rank = new_t1 + 1; rank <= old_t1; rank++) {
                _findAndRecordTierChange(rank, n);
            }
        }
    }
    // Similar logic for Tier 2 boundaries
}
```

**Key Point**: The protocol only updates users when **tier boundary counts change**, not when individual ranks shift. This means:

- **Typical case**: k = 0-5 users (when boundaries don't shift)
- **Moderate case**: k = 5-20 users (small boundary shifts)
- **Worst case**: k = 20-50 users (large boundary shifts) 

**Realistic Example with 1000 users**:
- Tier 1: 200 users (20%)
- Tier 2: 300 users (30%)
- Tier 3: 500 users (50%)

If tier boundaries shift from (200,300) to (201,300) (typical and coordinated):
- **k = 1 user** (rank 201 gets promoted to Tier 1)

Each affected user requires expensive operations:
```solidity
function _findAndRecordTierChange(uint256 rank, uint256 _stakerCountInTree) internal {
    uint256 joinId = stakerTree.findByCumulativeFrequency(rank);  // O(log n) ~5,000 gas
    address userCross = stakerAddress[joinId];                    // O(1) ~200 gas
    uint256 _rank = stakerTree.query(joinId);                     // O(log n) ~5,000 gas
    Tier toTier = _computeTierByRank(_rank, _stakerCountInTree);  // O(1) ~500 gas
    _recordTierChange(userCross, toTier);                         // O(1) + storage ~25,000 gas
    // Total: ~35,000 gas per affected user
}
```
This is typical for small growth, however rapid growth in a short period:
```solidity
// Example: Protocol grows from 95 to 105 users quickly
// Tier boundaries shift significantly:

// At 95 users:
// Tier 1: 19 users (20% of 95 = 19)
// Tier 2: 28 users (30% of 95 = 28.5 → 28)

// At 105 users:  
// Tier 1: 21 users (20% of 105 = 21)
// Tier 2: 31 users (30% of 105 = 31.5 → 31)

// Result: k = (21-19) + (31-28) = 2 + 3 = 5 users affected
```

Mass unstaking in successing would also cause moderate or worse case scenarios 

Or growth phases and market volatility scenarios.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Protocol must have multiple active stakers (>1)
2. Stakers must have varying stake amounts that create tier boundaries
3. The `minStakeAmount` threshold creates tier segregation
4. The protocol uses a tree-based ranking system (`stakerTree`) for tier calculations


### External Pre-conditions

1. Users must interact with the protocol (stake/unstake operations)
2. Network must have reasonable gas limits (Ethereum mainnet ~30M gas per block)
3. Gas prices must be economically significant for users
4. Protocol must have grown to a substantial user base (100+ users for noticeable impact)


### Attack Path


1. **Natural Growth**: As the protocol gains users organically, each new interaction becomes more expensive due to:
   - Increased tree depth (log n factor)
   - More frequent tier boundary shifts
   - Higher base gas costs for tree operations

2. **Intentional DoS**: An attacker could:
   - Create multiple stake positions just above `minStakeAmount` to maximize tree participants
   - Time stake/unstake operations to trigger maximum boundary shifts
   - Force other users to pay higher gas costs, especially during periods of high activity

3. **Economic DoS Progression** (Based on corrected analysis):
   - 10 users: ~649k-1.5M gas per transaction (manageable)
   - 100 users: ~1-3M gas per transaction (expensive)
   - 1000+ users: ~5-15M gas per transaction (prohibitively expensive)

Note: The protocol initializes the staker tree with a size limit:
```solidity
stakerTree.size = MAX_USERS; // 100_000_000
```
However, this only limits tree participants, not total users, as users staking below `minStakeAmount` are placed in tier 3 outside the tree.


### Impact


### High Severity Impact:
1. **Economic DoS**: Users cannot afford to interact with the protocol at scale
2. **Unfair Gas Distribution**: Early users pay less, later users pay significantly more
3. **Protocol Adoption Limitation**: Growth becomes self-limiting due to increasing gas costs
4. **User Experience Degradation**: Unpredictable and escalating transaction costs

### Specific Economic Impact:
- **100 users**: +100k-500k gas overhead per transaction
- **1,000 users**: +500k-2M gas overhead per transaction  
- **10,000 users**: +2M-10M gas overhead per transaction (economically prohibitive)


### PoC


`LayerEdgeStakingTest.t.sol`

Note that this doesn't count users who are out of tree forever/tier 3 and it only works with 24 users, as more people stake and unstake, more gas will need to be used for each iteraction because tiers will shift more often

Gas Usage Statistics:
  Average: 2024124
  Minimum: 1133118
  Maximum: 2965725
```
We can see that with 24 stakers each of then staking and unstaking the gas will bound quickly to about 1M without counting setup

**Gas Projections** (based on realistic k values and tree depth scaling):
- **100 users**: ~1-3M gas per transaction (expensive but manageable)
- **1,000 users**: ~5-15M gas per transaction (very expensive, economically prohibitive)
- **10,000 users**: ~20-50M gas per transaction (approaching block gas limits)

The test demonstrates clear gas cost escalation as the number of users increases, validating the O(k × log n) complexity concern.


### Mitigation

Add a  way to do tier updating via calculating tiers on demand
