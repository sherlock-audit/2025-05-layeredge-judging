# Launch Sabotage via Multi-Address Min-Stake

### Summary

The `minStakeAmount` is the minimum amount of `stakingToken` a staker must stake to be eligible for Tier1 or Tier2 APYs. The tier system works on a first come, first serve basis, so the earlier you stake, the greater chance you'll be pushed into Tier 1 or Tier 2 by stakers that stake after you. The system doesn't incentivize stakers to stake more than `minStakeAmount` and actually incentivizes staking exactly at the `minStakeAmount` from multiple addresses. 

A whale attacker could backrun the contract deployment and be the first to stake, but do so from  many different addresses using the `minStakeAmount`. This influx disincentivize other users from staking because they're much less likely from moving beyond Tier3. This damages the launch f the protocol. Once the launch buzz dies down and the damage is done, the attacker can unstake all addresses simultaneously, suddenly removing a large portion of the protocolâ€™s total staked amount.

### Root Cause

The first-come, first-serve tier system, combined with a fixed minStakeAmount, incentivizes whales to stake minimal amounts from multiple addresses, discouraging other users from staking and ultimately weakening the protocol by significantly reducing future participation and liquidity.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A whale stakes the min amount from many different addresses

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Whale attacker backruns deployment and immediately stakes exactly the minStakeAmount from many addresses, saturating early tier positions.
2. Other prospective stakers are disincentivized upon seeing all higher tiers occupied, significantly reducing organic staking participation during the critical launch window.
3. The anticipated growth and initial momentum stall due to reduced participation.
4. The attacker simultaneously unstakes from all addresses after the initial launch excitement fades.

### Impact

Significantly reduced participation and interest during the protocol's critical launch period, severely impairing initial growth and long-term adoption.
