# Malicious spender will drain tokens from token holder by front-running an `approve()` call

### Summary

The `approve()` function directly sets the allowance value for a spender without requiring the previous allowance to be zero. This allows a malicious spender to front-run the transaction and exploit the allowance before the new value is applied, potentially resulting in unintended token transfers by the approved party.

### Root Cause

The function sets the allowance blindly:

```solidity
function approve(address guy, uint256 wad) public returns (bool) { 
     allowance[msg.sender][guy] = wad; 
     emit Approval(msg.sender, guy, wad); 
     return true; 
 } 
```

This unconditionally replaces the current allowance, allowing a spender to utilize the existing allowance before it is overwritten by the new one.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- `approve()` is called with a new value for a non-zero existing allowance.
- No constraint forces allowance to be set to zero before resetting.

### External Pre-conditions

- A malicious or fast-running off-chain agent (e.g., bot or contract) monitors the mempool for allowance changes.
- The malicious spender is approved for token transfer.

### Attack Path

1. A user calls `approve(spender, newAmount)` where the spender was previously approved for some amount.
2. The transaction enters the mempool.
3. The spender sees the transaction and front-runs it with a `transferFrom()` using the existing (yet-to-be-overwritten) allowance.
4. The `transferFrom()` succeeds before `approve()` takes effect.
5. The user unintentionally allows an extra transfer, while they meant to change the allowance.

### Impact

The spender effectively uses both the old allowance and the new allowance, allowing double-spending beyond the token holderâ€™s intended limits.
