# New stakers tier will be misassigned after MAX_USERS registrations

### Summary

The unbounded increment of `nextJoinId` will cause an incorrect tier assignment for new stakers as users staking after the tree capacity (`MAX_USERS` = 100,000,000) is reached will not be added to the Fenwick tree and querying assigned index will return corrupted data.

### Root Cause

In [LayerEdgeStaking.sol::_stake](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L701), `nextJoinId` is incremented on every first-time stake (and never decremented). The Fenwick tree size is fixed at `MAX_USERS` = 100,000,000. Once `nextJoinId` > `MAX_USERS`, calls to `stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1)` silently do nothing (index > size) and subsequent `stakerTree.query(joinId)` returns corrupted data.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. 100,000,000 distinct addresses each stake ≥ `minStakeAmount` for the first time, incrementing `nextJoinId` from 1 to 100,000,001.
2. A new user stakes ≥ `minStakeAmount`, setting `user.joinId` = 100,000,001 (> `MAX_USERS`).

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. 100,000,000 users call `stake`(`amount` ≥ `minStakeAmount`) for the first time.
2. User #100,000,001 calls `stake`(`amount` ≥ `minStakeAmount`):
    - `user.joinId` is set to 100,000,001.
    - `stakerTree.update`(100,000,001, 1) is a no-op, so the tree does not record this user.
    - `stakerTree.query` returns wrong data.
    
3. User is assigned wrong tier.

### Impact

All users staking after the 100,000,000th first-time stake will be permanently placed in the wrong tier.

### PoC

Modify `LayerEdgeStaking.MAX_USERS` to 100 otherwise this will take forever.
Running the following PoC with MAX_USERS = 100 shows how wrong number of users are assigned tier1 and tier3 and none are even assigned tier2.

}
```

### Mitigation

Decrease `nextJoinId` when user is removed from the tree AND add a check if `nextJoinId` >= `MAX_USERS` then don't add to tree when staking.
