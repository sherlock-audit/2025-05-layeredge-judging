# Unbounded history arrays make claimInterest and calculateUnclaimedInterest revert once they grow large enough

### Summary

The contract stores every APY update in tierAPYHistory[tier] and every
promotion / demotion in stakerTierHistory[user] with no size
limit. Gas-cost for calculateUnclaimedInterest() is linear in the length of
those arrays, so after a sufficiently long lifetime (e.g. frequent APY
updates by governance, or an address that oscillates around a tier
boundary) the function will exceed the block gas-limit and revert.
As a result stakers lose the ability to claim or compound rewards.

### Root Cause


updateTierAPY() and updateAllAPYs() do tierAPYHistory[tier].push(APYPeriod({rate, startTime})) – unbounded.

_recordTierChange() does stakerTierHistory[user].push(TierEvent({from, to, timestamp})) – unbounded.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L834


calculateUnclaimedInterest() iterates over all entries in both arrays for the relevant tier(s) and user, doing O(n) work per call.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Governance (or an automation bot) changes APY frequently, or
A user’s rank crosses a tier boundary many times (e.g. whale staking in and out). → tierAPYHistory[tier].length or stakerTierHistory[user].length grows to several thousands.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Keeper updates APY once per hour for a year (≈ 8 700 entries in tierAPYHistory[t]).
Alice, an early staker, calls claimInterest().
calculateUnclaimedInterest() loops over every APY period and her entire tier history; gas usage exceeds the block limit (≈ 30–35 M) and the transaction reverts.

Or 

A user’s rank crosses a tier boundary many times (e.g. whale staking in and out).

From now on Alice (and eventually everyone) is unable to claim or compound; protocol effectively freezes claims without any malicious actor.

### Impact

• Users cannot claim or compound rewards once history arrays are large;
• Rewards remain locked, breaking a core function of the protocol;
• Front-end queries that call calculateUnclaimedInterest may also
revert, impacting UI.

### PoC

```solidity

// push 10 000 APY updates
for (uint i; i < 10_000; ++i) {
    vm.prank(admin);
    staking.updateTierAPY(LayerEdgeStaking.Tier.Tier1, 50 * 1e18);
}
// Alice stakes once
vm.prank(alice);
staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
// Alice tries to claim
vm.prank(alice);
staking.claimInterest();  // ⇨ out-of-gas / revert

```

### Mitigation

History trimming
Keep only the last N entries (e.g. last 365 updates) and assume the
oldest rate outside the window when calculating interest.

Checkpoint model
Maintain a per-tier cumulative index that compounds continuously:
index[t] += index[t] * apy[t] * dt / YEAR,
and store only the latest index value.
Per-user state becomes (principal, indexSnapshot), so
claimInterest is O(1).

Batch claiming
If complete refactor is not feasible, expose an admin function to
batch-settle old periods and squash them into one record,
periodically resetting array length.

Any of these measures bounds gas cost and guarantees
claimInterest remains callable for the lifetime of the protocol.
