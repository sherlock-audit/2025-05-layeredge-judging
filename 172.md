# Incorrect User Tier Status Due to Missing outOfTree Flag Update on Stake Increase

### Summary

The staking contract fails to update the `outOfTree` flag when a user who initially staked below the minimum threshold later increases their stake above the minimum. Because the `outOfTree` flag remains true, the user is incorrectly considered outside the active staking tree even though their stake qualifies them to be inside. This causes downstream logic, such as tier assignment and reward calculations, to behave incorrectly, potentially disadvantaging users who increase their stake after an initial small deposit.

### Root Cause

```solidity
    function _stake(uint256 amount, address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
    ,,,,,,,,,
        //Staking for first time and amount is less than minStakeAmount, user will be in tier 3 permanently and out of the tree
@>   if (!user.isActive && amount < minStakeAmount) {
            stakerCountOutOfTree++;
            user.isActive = true;
 @>     user.outOfTree = true;
            _recordTierChange(userAddr, tier);
        }

        // If first time staking, register staker position whose stake is more than minStakeAmount
@>   if (!user.isActive && amount >= minStakeAmount) {
            user.joinId = nextJoinId++;
            stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1);
            stakerAddress[user.joinId] = userAddr;
            user.isActive = true;
            stakerCountInTree++;

            uint256 rank = stakerTree.query(user.joinId);
            tier = _computeTierByRank(rank, stakerCountInTree);
            user.isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake = true;

            _recordTierChange(userAddr, tier);
            _checkBoundariesAndRecord(false);
        }
    }


    function _unstake(uint256 amount, address userAddr) internal {
        UserInfo storage user = users[userAddr];

        // require(user.isActive, "No active stake");
        require(user.balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        // Update interest before changing balance
        _updateInterest(userAddr);

        // Update user balances
        user.balance -= amount;
        user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;

        // Update total staked
        totalStaked -= amount;

@>    if (!user.outOfTree && user.balance < minStakeAmount) {
            // execute this before removing from tree, this will make sure to calculate interest
            //for amount left after unstake
            _recordTierChange(userAddr, Tier.Tier3);
            stakerTree.update(user.joinId, -1);
            stakerCountInTree--;
            user.outOfTree = true;
            stakerCountOutOfTree++;
            _checkBoundariesAndRecord(true);
        }

        // Add unstake request instead of immediate transfer
        unstakeRequests[userAddr].push(UnstakeRequest({amount: amount, timestamp: block.timestamp, completed: false}));

        emit UnstakedQueued(userAddr, unstakeRequests[userAddr].length - 1, amount);
    }
```

### Attack Path

1. The attacker or user stakes an amount less than the required `minStakeAmount.` This sets their `outOfTree` flag to true, marking them as inactive in the staking tree.

2. Later, the user stakes additional tokens, increasing their total stake above `minStakeAmount`. However, the `outOfTree` flag is never reset to false in this case.

3. Due to the stale `outOfTree` flag, the user remains excluded from the staking tree logic, such as tier calculations and reward distributions, even though they now meet the minimum staking requirements.

4. When the user attempts to `unstake`, the conditional logic relying on the `outOfTree` flag behaves incorrectly, potentially locking the user out of proper tier updates and causing inaccurate state management.

5. This leads to loss of rewards, incorrect tier assignments, and inconsistent staking data for the affected user.

### Impact

1. Users who initially stake below the minimum threshold but later increase their stake above it remain incorrectly marked as `outOfTree`, causing them to be excluded from the staking tree and tier benefits.

2. This leads to inaccurate tier calculations and reward distributions, potentially resulting in users losing earned rewards or staking benefits.

3. The staking poolâ€™s state becomes inconsistent, undermining trust and fairness in the system.

### Mitigation

```solidity
    function _stake(uint256 amount, address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
    ,,,,,,,,
        // If first time staking, register staker position whose stake is more than minStakeAmount
        if (!user.isActive && amount >= minStakeAmount) {
            user.joinId = nextJoinId++;
  ++      user.outOfTree = false;
            stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1);
            stakerAddress[user.joinId] = userAddr;
            user.isActive = true;
            stakerCountInTree++;

            uint256 rank = stakerTree.query(user.joinId);
            tier = _computeTierByRank(rank, stakerCountInTree);
            user.isFirstDepositMoreThanMinStake = true;

            _recordTierChange(userAddr, tier);
            _checkBoundariesAndRecord(false);
        }
    }
