# Whale can monopolize Tier 1

### Summary

Whale can monopolize Tier 1

### Root Cause

The way tiers are assigned to users is time-based rather than weight-based (stake amount). The earlier the staker is in the protocol (as long as above `minStakeAmount`), the better the tier they receive. Although there is a dynamic tiering system which changes users' tiers and promotes them (e.g. from tier 3 -> tier 2), users who lock in Tier 1 will never be demoted down to Tier 2.

>"Users are assigned to tiers based on their position in the staking queue (determined by their join ID)"

This creates a problematic whale attack since the better the tier, the higher the APY% the user locks in. If we assume for a moment that a whale has access to infinite capital, then they can sybil attack the protocol and as soon as they launch, lock in all positions of Tier 1 for themselves using multiple wallets.

1. Whale creates multiple wallets
2. Stakes exactly `minStakeAmount` per wallet to fill all Tier 1 positions
3. Lock out legitimate users from the best rewards

The only way for users to get demoted is if they unstake and go below the minimum, but a whale who maintains their stake will **never be demoted**. Once the whale fills Tier 1, legitimate users are permanently locked out unless they can convince whale wallets to unstake (which won't happen).

There are no anti-sybil measures in place such as whitelist, identity verification, stake-weighting mechanisms or minimum holding periods. Given the high ROI, this is very much plausible:

Example: 1,000 total stakers
- Tier 1: 200 positions (20%)  
- Whale cost: 200 * 3,000 = 600,000 EDGEN
- Whale's annual premium: 600,000 * 15% = 90,000 EDGEN
- Break-even time: Attack has no real "cost" since it's just staking
- Effective APY: 50% instead of 35% in Tier 2 => 42.86% better returns 

If we look at Scenario A:

- Whale stakes 600k in 1 wallet -> Tier 1
- Earns 300k EDGEN/year

Now, Scenario B:

- Whale stakes 600k across 200 wallets -> All Tier 1
- Earns 300k EDGEN/year
- Blocks 199 other users from Tier 1 rewards

Legitimate users lose out 15% APY, since 199 legitimate users lost Tier 1 access, if each user has an average of 10k EDGEN staked, it would mean 199 * 10,000 * 15% = 298,500 annual EDGEN blocked.

It is a zero-opportunity cost as it is the same as if staking 600k from a single wallet, the whale can unstake and withdraw if he wishes as well. Steals value from other users, no demotion mechanism and scales with growth due to the more users, the higher total value captured.

Simply said, the attack let's the whale steal 15% APY from legitimate users while earning him the same returns it would have earned anyway. It's pure value extracition with no downside.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Whale back-runs protocol deployment and monopolizes tier 1 all for himself

### Impact

1. Whale monopolizes Tier 1 with the best APY for himself, locking out other honest users to worse APY's
2. Zero-opportunity cost, the whale can unstake and withdraw if he wishes as well
3. Steals value from other users and scales with growth due to the more users, the higher total value captured

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Some sort of KYC/whitelist system to combat sybil attack
