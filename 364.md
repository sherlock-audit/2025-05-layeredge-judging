# Denial of Service via Mixed Native and Wrapped EDGEN Staking

### Summary

When the chain is LayerEdge, the staking contract allows any user to stake or unstake either native of wrapped EDGEN. If a user stakes wrapped EDGEN and unstakes native EDGEN, it can prevent users who staked native EDGEN from unstaking native EDGEN.  

### Root Cause

Any staker can unstake in native EDGEN, even those that staked the wrapped verison.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user stakes native EDGEN

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. User A stakes 3000e18 native EDGEN.
2. User B stakes 3000e18 wEDGEN
3. User B unstakes 300e18 native EDGEN
4. User A calls unstake then `completeUnstakeNative()`, but the call reverts.

### Impact

Users that staked native EDGEN can't unstake back to native EDGEN. This causes a poor user experience and can even confuse users into thinking their funds are locked.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Force unstaking in the currency that was staked.
