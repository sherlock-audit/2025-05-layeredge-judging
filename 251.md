# `WETH9` uses .transfer instead of .call when withdrawing

### Summary

`WETH9` uses [.transfer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/WETH9.sol#L26-L30) instead of .call when withdrawing

### Root Cause

The `LayerEdgeStaking` contract's `receive()` function has some simple checks:

```solidity
    receive() external payable {
        require(msg.sender == address(stakingToken), "Only staking token can send ETH");
    }
```

Although the gas cost for this is low, gas costs can change. There are some examples where it has happened in the past like EIP-2929 which increased SLOAD costs and there have also been compiler optimizations that change bytecode. When users finish their unstake and wish to receive their amount in native, `withdraw()` is called:

```solidity
    function _completeUnstake(address userAddr, uint256 index, bool isNative) internal {
        ...
        else {
>>          IWETH(address(stakingToken)).withdraw(request.amount);
            (bool success,) = payable(userAddr).call{value: request.amount}("");
            require(success, "Unstake native transfer failed");
        }
    }
```

Which uses the low-level .transfer instead of .call where the gas limit is capped to 2300:

```solidity
    function withdraw(uint256 wad) public {
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= wad);
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= wad;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(wad);
        emit Withdrawal(msg.sender, wad);
    }
```

This is very outdated and by using .tranfser instead of .call the protocol are shooting themselves in the foot. It is a 1 line of code change which will future-proof the contract and make sure that no issues can arise later. The inclusion of `withdraw()` in the unstaking flow is particularly critical as if it breaks then users' funds will be locked in the staking contract and be irretrieavable.

The only function to rescue funds is for rewards which checks how many have been deposited and cannot arbitraily withdraw:

```solidity
    function withdrawRewards(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        require(amount > 0, "Cannot withdraw zero amount");
        require(amount <= rewardsReserve, "Insufficient rewards");

        rewardsReserve -= amount;

        // Transfer tokens to admin
        require(stakingToken.transfer(owner(), amount), "Token transfer failed");
    }
```
