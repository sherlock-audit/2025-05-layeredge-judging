###Title: LayerEdgeStaking::depositRewards updates rewardsReserve before confirming token transfer 

Description

In the depositRewards() function, the contract increases rewardsReserve before making sure that the token transfer from the sender worked. If the transfer fails or returns false silently (non-standard ERC-20), the reserve will be higher than the actual token balance, causing a mismatch.

Here’s the function:
```solidity
function depositRewards(uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    require(amount > 0, "Cannot deposit zero amount");

    rewardsReserve += amount;

    require(stakingToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount), "Token transfer failed");

    emit RewardsDeposited(msg.sender, amount);
}
```

Impact

If transferFrom() fails or returns false, the reserve is still increased

This creates a fake balance the contract doesn’t actually own

Could break future withdrawals, reward logic, or user expectations

Breaks reward accounting and trust in rewardsReserve


Proof of Concept

1. User calls depositRewards(1000)

2. rewardsReserve += 1000 runs first

3. transferFrom() fails (maybe user didn’t approve enough)

4. Function reverts, but if token silently fails (non-standard), require() might pass

5. Now rewardsReserve is wrong — it says 1000 tokens were added but none were received

Recommended mitigation

Always transfer tokens before updating internal accounting. Update the function like this:
```solidity
require(stakingToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount), "Token transfer failed");
rewardsReserve += amount;
```

This makes sure the contract only tracks rewards it actually owns.
