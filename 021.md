# Missing Post-Upgrade ABI/Slot Verification

### Summary

After upgrades via UUPS, the code does not confirm new implementation’s ABI matches expected storage layout.

### Root Cause

No automated storage‐layout diff or slot‐check in the upgrade function.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Admin triggers upgradeTo().

### External Pre-conditions

Implementation contract has changed slot definitions.

### Attack Path

A malicious or faulty upgrade injects a new implementation that shifts storage, corrupting critical variables (e.g. admin role, APY arrays).

### Impact

Critical: full compromise of protocol state and admin privileges.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

• Integrate OpenZeppelin’s storage layout check (assertStorageLayout) in tests.
• On-chain, require a 48-hour time lock before applying the upgrade, with an on-chain slot‐hash verification step.
