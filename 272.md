# Stale Join ID References in Fenwick Tree Cause Incorrect Tier Assignments for Active Stakers

### Summary

When a Tier1 user unstakes and the total staker count later recovers to its original value, stale `joinId` references prevent active users from being promoted to Tier1, causing permanent loss of rewards.

### Root Cause

Stale stakerAddress Entries: When a user [unstakes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L725), their joinId is not cleared from stakerAddress, leaving references to inactive users
Inactive User Processing: Boundary checks process stale joinIds tied to inactive users, skipping updates for active users now occupying tier boundaries

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. An early staker (joinId=19, Tier1) unstakes fully, reducing `stakerCountInTree` by 1.
2. Tier boundaries shift (e.g., Tier1 now covers ranks 1–19 instead of 1–20).
3. After this a new staker stakes. going back to 100 total stakers

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Initial State:
100 stakers: Tier1 (ranks 1–20), Tier2 (21–50).
UserA: joinId=20, rank=20 (Tier1).
UserB: joinId=21, rank=21 (Tier2).

2. UserA Unstaking:
UserA unstakes, reducing `stakerCountInTree` to 99.
Tier1 recalculates to 19 users (20% of 99 = 19.8 → 19).
UserB’s New Rank: 21 → 20(Tier2).

3. New User Joins:
UserC stakes, increasing `stakerCountInTree` to 100.
Tier1 recalculates to 20 users (20% of 100 = 20).
UserB’s Rank:  20 (now eligible for Tier1).

4. Faulty Boundary Check:

`_checkBoundariesAndRecord` processes the Tier1 boundary (ranks 1–20):
```javascript
for (rank = 19; rank <= 20; rank++) {  
    _findAndRecordTierChange(rank, 100);  
}  
```
At rank=20:
`findByCumulativeFrequency(20)` returns `joinId=20` (UserA’s stale entry).
`_findAndRecordTierChange` checks `stakerAddress[20]` (points to UserA, outOfTree=true) and skips processing.
Result: UserB (now rank=20) is never promoted to Tier1, remaining in Tier2.

### Impact

UserB’s Loss: Earns Tier2 rewards (35% APY) instead of Tier1 (50% APY).
Example: For a $10,000 stake, $1,500/year loss.
Protocol Risk: Rewards reserve is underpaid to legitimate users

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Clear Stale stakerAddress Entries:
```javascript
// In _unstake:  
delete stakerAddress[user.joinId]; 
```

Validate Active Users in Tier Checks:
```javascript
function _findAndRecordTierChange(...) internal {  
    UserInfo storage user = users[userCross];  
    if (user.outOfTree || user.balance == 0) return; // Skip inactive users  
    // ...  
}  
```
