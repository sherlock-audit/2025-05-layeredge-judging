# Unrestricted Reward Withdrawal in LayerEdgeStaking Contract

### Summary

The LayerEdgeStaking contract allows the admin to withdraw rewards at any time without considering active stakes, pending `unstake` requests, or promised interest payments. This creates a potential rug pull scenario where the admin can withdraw all rewards, leaving users unable to claim their earned interest leaving their tokens locked.


### Root Cause

The withdrawRewards function lacks necessary checks and restrictions:

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Initial Setup:

- Admin deposits rewards to attract stakers
- Users stake based on promised APY rates
- Users earn interest over time

2. Rug Pull Execution:

- Admin withdraws all rewards
- Users try to claim interest but fail because of https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L222
- Admin can repeat the cycle with new rewards

### Impact

Critical Severity: Potential rug pull
Financial Impact: Users can't claim earned interest
User Experience: Loss of trust in the platform

### PoC

```solidity

function testRewardWithdrawalRugPull() public {
        // Setup
        address bereket = makeAddr("bereket");
        uint256 stakeAmount = MIN_STAKE;
        uint256 rewardAmount = 1_000_000 * 1e18;
        
        // Admin deposits rewards
        vm.startPrank(admin);
        token.transfer(bereket, MIN_STAKE * 10);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(admin);
        token.approve(address(staking), rewardAmount);
        staking.depositRewards(rewardAmount);
        vm.stopPrank();
        // User stakes
        vm.startPrank(bereket);
        token.approve(address(staking), stakeAmount);
        staking.stake(stakeAmount);

        // Wait for interest to accrue
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 30 days);
        
        // Admin withdraws all rewards
        vm.startPrank(admin);
        // withdraw all balance of the staking contract
        staking.withdrawRewards(staking.rewardsReserve());
        vm.stopPrank();
        
        // User tries to claim interest
        vm.startPrank(bereket);
        vm.expectRevert("Insufficient rewards in contract");
        staking.claimInterest();
        vm.stopPrank();
    }

```

### Mitigation

Implement proper reward withdrawal restrictions:

```solidity

function withdrawRewards(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    require(amount > 0, "Cannot withdraw zero amount");
    require(amount <= rewardsReserve, "Insufficient rewards");
    
    // Calculate required rewards for active stakes
    uint256 requiredRewards = calculateRequiredRewards();
    require(rewardsReserve - amount >= requiredRewards, "Cannot withdraw required rewards");
    
    // Check for pending unstake requests
    uint256 pendingUnstakeRewards = calculatePendingUnstakeRewards();
    require(rewardsReserve - amount >= pendingUnstakeRewards, "Cannot withdraw pending unstake rewards");
    
    // Check for pending interest claims
    uint256 pendingInterestClaims = calculatePendingInterestClaims();
    require(rewardsReserve - amount >= pendingInterestClaims, "Cannot withdraw pending interest claims");
    
    rewardsReserve -= amount;
    require(stakingToken.transfer(owner(), amount), "Token transfer failed");
}

```
