# Both native and staking token update user balance equally

### Summary

Both native and staking token update user balance equally and generate the same amount of interest.

### Root Cause

When users stake, their `user.balance` is increased here:

```solidity
    function _stake(uint256 amount, address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
        ...
        // Update user balances
        user.balance += amount;
        user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;

        // Update total staked
        totalStaked += amount;
    }
```

When users accrue interest, the function to update it uses that amount in the [interest calculation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/708c5b5345ed50cd0bde7b0a8a548c8936639683/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L443-L466):

```solidity
    function calculateUnclaimedInterest(address userAddr) public view returns (uint256 totalInterest) {
        ...
        // Calculate interest for this initial period
        if (periodEnd > periodStart) {
            uint256 apy = getTierAPYForPeriod(currentTier, periodStart, periodEnd);
            uint256 periodInterest =
>>              ((user.balance * apy * (periodEnd - periodStart)) / (SECONDS_IN_YEAR * PRECISION)) / 100;
            totalInterest += periodInterest;
        }

        // Then process any subsequent tier changes within our calculation window
        for (uint256 i = relevantStartIndex + 1; i < userTierHistory.length; i++) {
            if (userTierHistory[i].timestamp >= toTime) break;

            periodStart = userTierHistory[i].timestamp;
            periodEnd = (i == userTierHistory.length - 1) ? toTime : userTierHistory[i + 1].timestamp;
            if (periodEnd > toTime) periodEnd = toTime;

            if (periodEnd <= periodStart) continue;

            Tier periodTier = userTierHistory[i].to;
            uint256 apy = getTierAPYForPeriod(periodTier, periodStart, periodEnd);

            uint256 periodInterest =
>>              ((user.balance * apy * (periodEnd - periodStart)) / (SECONDS_IN_YEAR * PRECISION)) / 100;
            totalInterest += periodInterest;
        }
        return totalInterest;
    }
```

But the accounting during the staking process doesn't differentiate whether the user staked using native eth or the staking token. Since on mainnet the staking token will be EDGEN, and there currently is no data on if it will be a pegged stablecoin or not, I have assumed that it could create a problematic scenario.

In case 1e18 amount of EDGEN token costs less than 1e18 native ETH, users who stake with it will accumulate the same amount of interest for a lesser price. This is allowed not only by the fact that an oracle isn't used in the protocol, but also since the calculation for user interest simply uses the amount of `user.balance` without differentiating what was deposited, regardless of valuation.

This is amplified by the fact that stakers can later withdraw their accrued interest in the more valuable of the 2 tokens.

### Impact

No oracles used for token pricing will allow some users to profit and arbitrage on the back of others. When tokens are priced differently, Alice will always stake the less valuable token, generate the same interest as other users and then withdraw their generated interest in the more valuable token.
