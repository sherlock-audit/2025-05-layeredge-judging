# [M-02] Lack of Upper Bound Enforcement in update() Allows Writes Beyond Logical Tree Size

### Summary

The update() function of the FenwickTree library only checks that index > 0, but fails to verify that index <= self.size. This allows updates to occur at indices beyond the declared size of the tree, leading to silent corruption of the internal structure and inaccurate cumulative frequency calculations.

### Root Cause

The function found in [Lines 11-12 in FenwickTree.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/library/FenwickTree.sol#L11-L12) does not restrict the initial value of index from exceeding self.size. Since Solidity mappings do not throw on out-of-bounds access, this oversight allows unbounded updates to unintended memory slots.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Self.size is initialized to a known value.
2. The internal mapping self.data is used to store prefix sums and assumes updates happen only within 1..self.size.

### External Pre-conditions

1. An external contract or user has access to call the update() function with arbitrary index and delta values.

### Attack Path

1. A user calls update(tree, index, delta) where index > self.size.
2. The require(index > 0) check passes.
3. The function enters the while (index <= self.size) loop only if the current index is less than or equal to self.size.
4. However, if the initial index > self.size, the function skips the loop but still silently accepts the invalid input â€” no correction or warning is made.
5. Future iterations inside the loop could access and write to self.data[index] beyond the logical bounds on subsequent calls (or if index were to be manipulated inside the loop).

### Impact

1. Logical corruption of the Fenwick Tree's state.
2. Future calls to query() or findByCumulativeFrequency() will produce inaccurate results due to polluted prefix sum values.
3. If used in token accounting, staking, or reputation systems, this can lead to privilege escalation, incorrect rewards, or DoS through corrupted internal data.

### PoC

```solidity
FenwickTree.Tree storage tree;
tree.size = 10;

// This call succeeds but updates index 15, which is outside tree.size
tree.update(15, 100);

// self.data[15] now has a value, but is outside the logical bounds of the Fenwick Tree.
// Prefix sums will be inaccurate, and future calls could behave unpredictably.
```

### Mitigation

Add an upper-bound check inside update():
```solidity
require(index <= self.size, "Index exceeds tree size");
```
