# Raising minStakeAmount leaves under-collateralised users in Tier 1/2, breaking the 20 / 30 / 50 % distribution invariant

### Summary

The contract lets the owner update the minimum stake via setMinStakeAmount().
Because no re-validation of existing stakers is performed, raising this value will cause many addresses whose balance is now below the new minimum to stay inside the Fenwick tree and to keep their previous (often Tier 1 or Tier 2) positions.
Consequently the percentages “exactly 20 % Tier 1, 30 % Tier 2, 50 % Tier 3” (required by the specification) become meaningless; later joiners compete for tier slots against users that would no longer qualify under the new rule.

### Root Cause

setMinStakeAmount() merely assigns the new value:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L334

function setMinStakeAmount(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    minStakeAmount = amount;
}

Tier membership is refreshed only when _stake, _unstake, or _checkBoundariesAndRecord
run.  No function scans the current tree and evicts users whose
balance < minStakeAmount after the owner’s update.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Some users are active stakers, several of them with balances near the old minimum.
Owner calls setMinStakeAmount(newMin) where newMin > at least one existing user’s balance.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

System runs with 100 users; thresholds are honoured.
Owner (or governance script) doubles the minimum stake.
70 of the 100 addresses are now below the requirement but stay in Tier 1/2/3 as before.
Tier boundaries still assume “100 users in tree”, so ranks and promotions continue to be computed using outdated counts; proportions are incorrect and fairness is lost.

### Impact

• Tier distribution invariant is violated: Tier 1 may contain >20 % or
Tier 2 >30 % of qualifying users.
• Early stakers benefit from higher APY even though they no longer meet
the policy; new users must deposit ≥ newMin yet still start in Tier 3.
• Off-chain analytics that rely on getTierCounts() are wrong.

### PoC

```solidity

function test_raiseMinStake_leavesOldUsers() public {
    // Alice & Bob stake exactly old minimum
    vm.prank(alice); staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
    vm.prank(bob);   staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);

    // Owner doubles the minimum
    vm.prank(admin);
    staking.setMinStakeAmount(MIN_STAKE * 2);

    // Neither user is evicted, still Tier-1 and Tier-2
    assertEq(uint256(staking.getCurrentTier(alice)), uint256(LayerEdgeStaking.Tier.Tier1));
    assertEq(uint256(staking.getCurrentTier(bob)),   uint256(LayerEdgeStaking.Tier.Tier2));
}

```

### Mitigation

Option A – Immediate sweep
After updating minStakeAmount, iterate through the Fenwick tree once
and:

```solidity
if (users[addr].balance < minStakeAmount) {
    stakerTree.update(joinId, -1);
    users[addr].outOfTree = true;
    _recordTierChange(addr, Tier.Tier3);
}

```

Option B – Prevent unsafe change
Require the new minimum to be ≤ the smallest balance currently in the
tree:

```solidity
require(minStakeAmount <= lowestActiveBalance, "would orphan stakers");

```
Either solution preserves the 20/30/50 percentage invariant specified
in the README and keeps tier assignments consistent after policy
changes.
