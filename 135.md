# 🟠 Medium Severity: No protection against tokens with transfer fees

## 🐛 Issue: No protection against tokens with transfer fees

**File:** `edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol`  
**Line:** 253  

```solidity
require(stakingToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount), "Token transfer failed");

This line assumes that the full amount sent by the user will be received by the contract.
However, some ERC20 tokens apply transfer fees or taxes, reducing the actual amount received.

As a result, the contract may credit users for more tokens than it receives,
leading to misaccounting in reward logic or tier misclassification in the staking system.

🔐 Impact
Inaccurate reward distribution due to inflated staking amounts.

Users may gain unintended tier advantages.

Potential for malicious exploitation using deflationary tokens.

### ✅ Recommendation  
Verify the actual token balance received after transfer.  
**For example:**

```solidity
uint256 before = stakingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
stakingToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
uint256 after = stakingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
require(after - before == amount, "Received less than expected");
```

Alternatively, consider enforcing the use of non-deflationary tokens through documentation or token whitelisting.
