# Static-tier users will receive outdated APY if no tier events occur after claiming

### Summary

The assumption that tier transitions will occur between every claim causes incorrect APY to be used for long-term users as the contract fails to account for changing APY values in static-tier periods.

### Root Cause

In [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#489](https://github.com/zaid261-spec/2025-05-layeredge-zaid261-spec/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L489), calculateUnclaimedInterest() relies on the stakerTierHistory to slice periods and apply correct APY. However, if a user remains in the same tier and no TierEvent is added, APY updates are never rechecked — even if admins change APYs.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User joins Tier 2, then claims interest.
2. Admin updates Tier 2 APY via updateAllAPYs()
3. User remains in Tier 2, and no TierEvent is added.

### External Pre-conditions

None — this is a logical design gap.

### Attack Path

1. User stakes and enters Tier 2.
2. Admin updates Tier 2 APY from 35% to 20%.
3. User claims rewards 10 days later, still receives rewards based on 35% APY.
4. Since no tier change occurred, APY change is never factored in.

### Impact

User receives incorrect rewards — overpaid or underpaid depending on APY change. This weakens trust and may violate expected returns.

### PoC

// Stake → claim → APY update → wait → claim again
// Observe APY rate mismatch despite unchanged tier


### Mitigation

Modify calculateUnclaimedInterest() to additionally track tierAPYHistory timestamps per tier, even when no TierEvent exists. Slice based on APY changes if TierEvent list is unchanged.
