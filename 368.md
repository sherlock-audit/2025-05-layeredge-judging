# Missing `MAX_USERS` enforcement causes tree desynchronization

### Summary

The missing `MAX_USERS` enforcement in `edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol` causes a desynchronized state between the Fenwick Tree and tier calculations for all stakers, as new stakers are allowed to join beyond the tree’s size and trigger logic that does not update tree data but still increments `stakerCountInTree`, which is a core variable used in tier count calculation logic.

### Root Cause

According to the design, the Fenwick Tree size fixed at `100,000,000` (through `MAX_USERS` constant). However, the `_stake` function does not enforce a cap on the number of users (`MAX_USERS`) when a new staker joins with `amount >= minStakeAmount`. This allows `user.joinId` to exceed the size of the Fenwick Tree, therefore the tree data is not updated. Then, `stakerCountInTree` is still incremented (exceed `MAX_USERS`), without corresponding updates to the tree, causing inconsistencies between tier logic and the actual staker state stored in the tree.

In `edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L700-L713`:

```solidity
if (!user.isActive && amount >= minStakeAmount) {
    // @audit Missing `MAX_USERS` enforcement

    user.joinId = nextJoinId++; // <- This index could exceed tree size

    // `update` silently does nothing if `index > stakerTree.size`
    stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1);
    stakerAddress[user.joinId] = userAddr;
    user.isActive = true;
    stakerCountInTree++; // <- Incremented unconditionally

    ...
}
```

In `edgen-staking/src/library/FenwickTree.sol#L10-L16`, the `update` function stops applying updates if `index > self.size`, meaning users beyond the max index silently bypass data update (in this case is staker's rank data):

```solidity
    function update(Tree storage self, uint256 index, int256 delta) internal {
        require(index > 0, "Index must be > 0");
@>      while (index <= self.size) {
            self.data[index] = uint256(int256(self.data[index]) + delta);
            index += lsb(index);
        }
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A staker joins the protocol when `stakerCountInTree >= MAX_USERS`
2. The staker's `amount >= minStakeAmount` and `user.isActive == false`

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. When `stakerCountInTree >= MAX_USERS`, A user joins the staking contract as a new staker, with `amount >= minStakeAmount`, triggering `_stake()`
2. Their `joinId` exceeds the maximum index size of the Fenwick Tree
3. `stakerTree.update()` is called, but the loop exits immediately with no update to the tree
4. `stakerCountInTree` is incremented despite no corresponding tree update
5. Functions such as `getTierCountForStakerCount` use this inflated `stakerCountInTree`, incorrectly calculating tier counts

### Impact

The tree and staker count become inconsistent, and the system behaves as though more users are in the tree than actually are. The affected party (users and protocol logic relying on tier data) cannot rely on `getTierCountForStakerCount()` or rank queries, possibly affecting staking rewards.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Add an enforcement mechanism:

```diff
    if (!user.isActive && amount >= minStakeAmount) {
+       require(nextJoinId <= MAX_USERS, "Full staker in tree")
        user.joinId = nextJoinId++;
        stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1);
        stakerAddress[user.joinId] = userAddr;
        user.isActive = true;
        stakerCountInTree++;
```
