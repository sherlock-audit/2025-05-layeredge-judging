# Emergency-withdraw function can’t recover tokens that are in the contract but not reflected in rewardsReserve

### Summary

withdrawRewards() subtracts and transfers only an amount ≤ rewardsReserve.
If the contract ever holds staking-tokens (or ETH) that are not counted in rewardsReserve—for example, someone sends EDGEN/WETH directly, or a book-keeping bug leaves the variable under-reported—the excess funds become permanently locked, because no function lets the owner skim the true balance.
Thus a bookkeeping mismatch will cause permanent loss of treasury funds while the owner, the party expected to perform the shutdown, cannot retrieve them.

### Root Cause

In LayerEdgeStaking.sol (withdrawRewards):

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L310C1-L318C6

```solidity
require(amount <= rewardsReserve, "Insufficient rewards");
rewardsReserve -= amount;
require(stakingToken.transfer(owner(), amount), "Token transfer failed");
```

The function’s upper-bound check and the state update rely solely on the
rewardsReserve variable; it never looks at the actual ERC-20 balance
of the contract or at accidentally received ETH or other tokens.

### Internal Pre-conditions

rewardsReserve < stakingToken.balanceOf(address(this)) – caused by a missed book-keeping event or by a user directly calling stakingToken.transfer(contract, x)
Owner calls withdrawRewards() with any amount.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

10 000 EDGEN are sent straight to the contract (no depositRewards call) → rewardsReserve unchanged.
Owner tries to shut down and calls withdrawRewards(10_000) – reverts because amount > rewardsReserve.
Owner tries a lower amount equal to rewardsReserve; call succeeds, but the 10 000 EDGEN remain stuck forever, with no function to sweep them.

### Impact

• Protocol treasury (affected party) loses access to all staking-tokens
that are not mirrored in rewardsReserve.

### PoC

```solidity

function test_lockedFunds() public {
    // someone mistakenly sends tokens directly
    token.transfer(address(staking), 1_000 ether);
    assertEq(token.balanceOf(address(staking)), 1_000 ether);
    assertEq(staking.rewardsReserve(), 0);

    // owner tries to recover
    vm.prank(admin);
    vm.expectRevert("Insufficient rewards");
    staking.withdrawRewards(1_000 ether);
}

```

### Mitigation

Allow the owner to sweep the full on-chain balance:

```solidity
function emergencySweep() external onlyOwner {
    uint256 bal = stakingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    stakingToken.transfer(owner(), bal);
    rewardsReserve = 0; // or recalc if you keep using it
}
```
