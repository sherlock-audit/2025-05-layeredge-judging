### Title:
LayerEdgeStaking::unstake doesn’t check if unstake amount is more than staked balance 

> Function: LayerEdgeStaking::unstake


```solidity
function unstake(uint256 amount) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant updateTierOnChange(msg.sender) {
    require(amount > 0, "Cannot unstake zero");

    Stake storage stake = userStakes[msg.sender];
    require(stake.amount > 0, "No active stake");

    stake.amount -= amount;
    totalStaked -= amount;

    fenwickTree.remove(msg.sender);

    stakingToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);

    emit Unstaked(msg.sender, amount);
}
```

Description

The function lets users unstake tokens, but it doesn't check if the amount passed in is more than the user’s actual staked amount. This can lead to logic bugs or unexpected errors. Contracts should always verify that a user isn’t trying to do something invalid — like unstaking more than they own.

Impact

If someone passes in a bigger amount than they staked, it can cause:
Internal math to underflow or go wrong
Transfers to fail
 Fenwick tree updates to break
Also, users don’t get a clear error for a bad input

Proof of Concept

1. Alice has 1,000 tokens staked


2. She calls unstake(5000)


3. require(stake.amount > 0) passes


4. Then this line runs:

stake.amount -= amount;

which will underflow or throw depending on compiler


5. Execution reverts, or logic gets stuck if unchecked


Recommended mitigation

Add this line before updating the stake:

require(amount <= stake.amount, "Trying to unstake too much");

That way the function always validates that the user isn’t requesting more than they’re allowed to.
