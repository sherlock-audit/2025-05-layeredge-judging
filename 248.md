# Potential Integer Underflow in FenwickTree.update

### Summary

The FenwickTree.update function performs arithmetic operations involving signed integers cast from unsigned storage without proper boundary checks. This can lead to a runtime revert due to underflow when a negative delta causes the resulting value to drop below zero. Since the operation is cast back into an unsigned integer (uint256), any negative result is invalid and will trigger an exception.



### Root Cause

In Solidity 0.8+, converting a negative int256 value into uint256 triggers an automatic overflow/underflow check. The update() function does not guard against cases where delta < 0 and the current value is too small (or zero), resulting in an invalid operation like converting -5 to uint256.

```solidity
self.data[index] = uint256(int256(self.data[index]) + delta); // unsafe
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

self.data[index] has a non-zero value or zero (worst-case).

delta is negative (e.g., -1).

Function is called by trusted internal logic (e.g., during staking/un-staking).

### External Pre-conditions

A user triggers an operation that causes update(..., -1) to be called (e.g., unstaking below threshold).

Internal balance at index is 0 or less than |delta|.

This may occur during:

_unstake()

Tier boundary updates

Automatic tree balancing logic



### Attack Path

A user unstakes or triggers logic that removes them from the Fenwick Tree.

The system calls:

```solidity
stakerTree.update(user.joinId, -1);
```
If self.data[user.joinId] == 0, then int256(0) + (-1) = -1.

Solidity attempts uint256(-1), which causes a revert.

The entire transaction fails unexpectedly.



### Impact

Any logic relying on tree updates (like tier transitions, unstaking, or reward recalculations) may fail silently or revert unexpectedly.

Could prevent users from unstaking or re-entering tiers.

May create a denial-of-service vector if such state is common.

Reduces contract robustness and introduces fragility under edge cases.

### PoC

Assume self.data[5] == 0:

```solidity
// Call that leads to internal underflow
stakerTree.update(5, -1);
```
Result:

```plaintext
int256(0) + (-1) = -1
uint256(-1) => REVERT
```


### Mitigation

 Add a safe boundary check before casting:

```solidity

function update(Tree storage self, uint256 index, int256 delta) internal {
    require(index > 0, "Index must be > 0");

    while (index <= self.size) {
        int256 newValue = int256(self.data[index]) + delta;
        require(newValue >= 0, "FenwickTree underflow"); // üõ°Ô∏è Key fix
        self.data[index] = uint256(newValue);
        index += lsb(index);
    }
}
```
 Optional: Add custom error for gas optimization in production:

```solidity

error UnderflowDetected(uint256 index, int256 delta);
```
 Optionally enforce only positive updates if tree is used for counts only.
