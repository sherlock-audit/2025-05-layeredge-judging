# Increasing minStake won't make "new" underwater positions ineligible for higher tier promotion

### Summary

The protocol works the following way:

In case user either deposit less then minStakeAmount or unstake and his total staked less then minStakeAmount it supposed to throw him out of fenwick tree. This means he won't be eligible for any promotions in a future and will sit at tier3 permanently.
Meanwhile protocol is able to increase minimum stake amount via 
```solidity
    function setMinStakeAmount(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        minStakeAmount = amount;
    }
```
Increasing amount "technically" will make some of positions underwater, but WILL NOT make them tier 3 permanently.
 
NOTE: This was likely done by design, to ensure users will be able to increase their positions in a future and not stuck in t3.

The problem is there is no any future validation for such position, i.e. whether they actually increased their stake to be eligible for new tier promotion.

Described edge case will lead to higher tier promotion for underwater stake positions 


### Root Cause

While first time stake and unstake protocol executes tier checks and updates the tier within the tree. 
Key point here, even if who stake/unstake not eligible for any promotion it will find the one who eligible via _checkBoundariesAndRecord() flow to keep the tree up to date .
The problem with this flow, is it expected to have stakers amount in tree already updated. I.e. if user position become underwater it suppose to know it before. So i assume the root cause for this issue is missing flow for handling such case - i.e. when protocol don't want to make it permanently tier 3, and, on an other hand, do not want for this user to be promoted.


### Internal Pre-conditions

Protocol will raise minStakeAmount
There is a users who stake exactly old minStakeAmount or less than new one

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Will happens itself
1)Protocol raise minStake
2)Users who have underwater position now will able to be promoted to higher tier

### Impact

ineligible users unfairly promoted to higher tier, which means :
They took higher tier spot for eligible users
They earning unfairly more than they should be 
Aso it breaks the following invariant:
> **Permanent tier demotion: Users who unstake below minStakeAmount should permanently remain in Tier 3(Out of tree/system)**
