# All-or-nothing rewards claiming prevents partial withdrawal when contract has insufficient reserves

### Summary

## Description

The `LayerEdgeStaking::_claimInterest` function implements an all-or-nothing approach for rewards claiming, preventing users from withdrawing any earned interest when the contract's `rewardsReserve` is insufficient to cover their full claimable amount. This creates a situation where users with legitimate earned rewards cannot access any portion of them, even when the contract has partial funds available.

The issue stems from the strict requirement check that reverts the entire transaction if full payment cannot be made:

```solidity
## LayerEdgeStaking.sol
function _claimInterest(address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
    _updateInterest(userAddr);
    
    UserInfo storage user = users[userAddr];
    uint256 claimable = user.interestEarned;
    
    require(claimable > 0, "Nothing to claim");
    require(rewardsReserve >= claimable, "Insufficient rewards in contract"); // @audit - All-or-nothing check
    
    // ... rest of function
}
```

The same vulnerability exists in `LayerEdgeStaking::compoundInterest` function.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue is that the `LayerEdgeStaking` contract does not implement partial claiming functionality. This means that users who have earned rewards will not be able to withdraw any portion of them, even when the contract has partial funds available. This can lead to frustration and loss of trust in the platform.

### Impact

The impact of this issue is that users who have earned rewards will not be able to withdraw any portion of them, even when the contract has partial funds available. This also means whale user won't be able to withdraw rewards will little users will be, which is definitely unfair.

### PoC

1. User stakes tokens and accumulates 1,000 tokens worth of interest over several months
2. Contract's `rewardsReserve` drops to 300 tokens due to insufficient reward deposits or high claiming activity
3. User calls `LayerEdgeStaking::claimInterest` to withdraw their earned rewards
4. Function reverts at the `require(rewardsReserve >= claimable)` check
5. User cannot access any portion of their 1,000 tokens earned interest, despite the contract having 300 tokens available
6. User must wait indefinitely until someone deposits enough rewards to cover their full amount

### Mitigation

**Implement partial claiming**
```diff
function _claimInterest(address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
    _updateInterest(userAddr);
    
    UserInfo storage user = users[userAddr];
    uint256 claimable = user.interestEarned;
    
    require(claimable > 0, "Nothing to claim");
-   require(rewardsReserve >= claimable, "Insufficient rewards in contract");
+   
+   // Allow partial claiming up to available reserves
+   uint256 actualClaim = claimable > rewardsReserve ? rewardsReserve : claimable;
+   require(actualClaim > 0, "No rewards available");
    
    user.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;
-   user.interestEarned = 0;
+   user.interestEarned = claimable - actualClaim;
-   user.totalClaimed += claimable;
+   user.totalClaimed += actualClaim;
    
-   rewardsReserve -= claimable;
+   rewardsReserve -= actualClaim;
    
    // Transfer actualClaim instead of claimable
}
```
