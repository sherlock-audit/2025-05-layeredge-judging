# Under certain circumstances, a staker who should be upgraded to Tier 2 will remain at Tier 3

### Summary

The logic for updating a staker's tier is incorrect for the case where the number at tier 1 changes while the number at tier 2 remains the same. Specifically, when the number of stakers goes from 14 to 15, or from 24 to 25, etc, then the staker at rank 7/12/... will not be updated to tier 2, even though they should be.

Thus, they will not get enough interest.

However, once the 16th/26th/... staker is added, then their tier will change, belatedly.

It is debatable whether this is the same issue as the one I submitted under the title "Under certain circumstances, a staker may remain at tier 2, no matter how many people unstake". You can say it's two root causes -- there is incorrect code for updating ranks when adding a user and the number of stakers in tier 1 but not tier 2 changes, and there is likewise a separate line of incorrect code for removing a user in such a case. Or you can say it's one root cause: the code for the two cases is swapped. But Sherlock rules dictate I must submit them separately.

### Root Cause

Consider the code that runs to update tiers when the number of tier 1 stakers changes but the number of tier 2 stakers does not.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L894-L898

These two cases are swapped. During removal, the user at the old boundary may change from tier 3 to tier 2, but it only checks the user at the new boundary.

When the number of stakers changes from 14 to 15, the staker ranked 7 should be upgraded to tier 2 but remains at tier 3. They will instead be upgraded to tier 2 when the 16th staker is added; even though adding a 17th, 27th, 37th etc staker can never change anyone's rank, the code will still check, partially cancelling out this bug.


### Internal Pre-conditions

Happens to a certain unlucky staker whenever the number of stakers is > 10 and congruent to 5 mod 10.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

N/A -- this just happens.


### Impact

Some stakers will get less interest than they should.

```solidity
    function getActualTier(address user) public view returns (LayerEdgeStaking.Tier) {
        (,,,, LayerEdgeStaking.TierEvent[] memory history) = staking.getAllInfoOfUser(user);
        return history[history.length - 1].to;
    }


    function test_LayerEdgeStaking_15thStaker() public {

        // Setup initial 14 stakers
        address[14] memory initialStakers = [
            alice, bob, charlie, dave, eve, frank,
            grace, heidi, ivan, judy,

        ];
        
        // Setup initial stakers
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < initialStakers.length; i++) {
            dealToken(initialStakers[i], MIN_STAKE);
            vm.startPrank(initialStakers[i]);
            token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE);
            staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
            vm.stopPrank();
        }

        // Add 15th staker
        dealToken(olivia, MIN_STAKE);
        vm.startPrank(olivia);
        token.approve(address(staking), MIN_STAKE);
        staking.stake(MIN_STAKE);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // At this point, Grace should be in Tier 2, but is actually in Tier 3. The getCurrentTier function lies about her tier.
        (,LayerEdgeStaking.Tier supposedTier,,, LayerEdgeStaking.TierEvent[] memory graceHistoryAfter) = staking.getAllInfoOfUser(grace);
        LayerEdgeStaking.TierEvent memory graceLastTierChangeEventAfter = graceHistoryAfter[graceHistoryAfter.length - 1];

        // This assertion will fail, which means Grace will not get enough interest.
        // But comment it out to see the rest of the test. 
        assertEq(uint256(supposedTier), uint256(graceLastTierChangeEventAfter.to), "The tier returned by getCurrentTier should match the actual tier, as determined by their last tier change");

        // Now let's prove that Grace is getting 20% interest, not the 35% she's owed
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 365 days);
        (,,, uint256 graceInterest) = staking.getUserInfo(grace);
        (,,, uint256 frankInterest) = staking.getUserInfo(frank);
        console2.log("Frank's interest after 1 year:", frankInterest);
        console2.log("Grace's interest after 1 year:", graceInterest);

        // Indeed, Grace is getting less interest than Frank, even though they should be both in Tier 2
        // This assertion will fail.
        assertEq(frankInterest, graceInterest, "Frank and Grace should get the same interest");
        
  }
```

### Mitigation

Swap the two swapped code branches. But really, make that function simpler. It's way too complicated -- no wonder there's a bug!
