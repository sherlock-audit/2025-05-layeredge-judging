# Potential Rounding Errors in Interest Calc

### Summary

calculateUnclaimedInterest() uses integer division and timestamp deltas without explicit precision checks.

### Root Cause

No fixed-point math library; relies on Solidity’s truncating division.

### Internal Pre-conditions

User stakes or APY changes occur at high frequency.

### External Pre-conditions

Block timestamps vary slightly.

### Attack Path

Repeated small-time‐slice calculations accumulate cumulative rounding loss, leading to underpaying or overpaying users by integer trimmings.

### Impact

Medium: protocol loses or mints small amounts of tokens over time.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

• Switch to FixedPointMath with 1e18 precision.
• On each calc, accumulate the “remainder” and carry it forward.
