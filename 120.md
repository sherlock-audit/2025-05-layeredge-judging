# Attacker can lock protocol/user funds by exploiting ETH transfer gas griefing

### Summary

The lack of gas usage checks in completeUnstakeNative() and claimInterestNative() will cause a permanent loss of access to funds for users, as an attacker can use a contract address with a gas-exhausting or reverting fallback to block or revert ETH transfers, resulting in denial of service for withdrawals and claims.

### Root Cause

In [LayerEdgeStaking.sol:192](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L192) (completeUnstakeNative(uint256 index)) and [LayerEdgeStaking.sol:206](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L206) (claimInterestNative()), the ETH transfer is made using a low-level call without verifying if the recipient is a contract or handling cases where the fallback function reverts or consumes excessive gas.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User sets their claim or unstake recipient address to a contract (e.g., a “GasHog” or reverting fallback).
2. The protocol allows ETH transfers to arbitrary recipient addresses.

### External Pre-conditions

No external protocol, price feed, or network conditions are required. All steps occur within LayerEdge and the attacker’s contract.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker deploys a contract with a fallback that consumes all gas or always reverts (see PoC).
2. Sets their withdrawal/claim/unstake address in LayerEdge to this contract.
3. Calls completeUnstakeNative() or claimInterestNative() to trigger the ETH send.
4. The ETH transfer always fails or reverts, locking the claim or causing repeated DoS.


### Impact

The user or protocol cannot withdraw or claim native ETH, resulting in permanent lockup or denial of service for affected users/operations.



### PoC

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

// A contract that always reverts on receiving ETH
contract RevertingReceiver {
    receive() external payable {
        revert("ETH rejected!");
    }
}

// Or, a contract that consumes all gas (gas griefing)
contract GasHog {
    receive() external payable {
        while (true) {} // Infinite loop to exhaust all gas
    }
}



How to use:

1. Deploy RevertingReceiver or GasHog.

2. Set your withdrawal/claim/unstake address in LayerEdge to this contract address.

3. Call completeUnstakeNative() or claimInterestNative() from LayerEdge.

4. The transaction will always revert or run out of gas; your funds remain locked.

### Mitigation

Implement rescue logic for failed ETH sends, use OpenZeppelin’s Address.sendValue (which reverts on failure and is considered safer), or restrict native ETH transfers to EOAs only.
