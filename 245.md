# Lack of option to partially claim interest means that, when rewards are not fully funded, stakers with lots of interest may be unable to claim any interest

### Summary

In both compoundInterest and claimReward, the only option is for a user to claim 100% of their reward.

Funding for rewards is not automatically available. It must be deposited by the protocol owners or other beneficiaries. 

If the amount available in the rewards pool is insufficient to cover all interest, then whoever claims last will be unable to claim any interets.

Suppose there are two stakers, Alice and Bob. Bob deposits 1 token and is owed 0.3 tokens of reward. Alice deposits 1000000 tokens and is owed 500000 tokens of reward. The protocol owners deposit 500000 tokens of rewards. Bob claims first. There are now only  499999.7 tokens in the reward pool. Alice is now completely unable to withdraw any of her rewards.

If either another exploit allows anyone to claim a disproportionate share of rewards, the rewards pool is slow to be funded (no timescale is given as to whether we can expect the rewards pool to always be fully funded or to be funded with a delay, even if nothing else happens), or the project for whatever reason runs into financial trouble, then this creates a situation where the people who support the project the most get punished the most.

And there is indeed an issue that allows some stakers to claim a disproportionate share of rewards, meaning this can happen even when the protocol is fully funded. Specifically, I've submitted such an exploit (with a POC), under the title "Under certain circumstances, a staker may remain at tier 2, no matter how many people unstake." I am including the POC for that vuln in this issue as well, for self-containedness.

One might counter that Alice does have the ability to liberate her stake by acquiring EDGEN elsewhere and depositing it herself. But in doing so, she is forfeiting her own interest in an amount proportional to the shortfall, and thereby replacing a potentially-impermanent loss of funds with a permanent one.

This issue is similar to issue M-5 of the OpenQ contest, https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/39/report .

### Root Cause

In [LayerEdgeStacking.sol:782-788 ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L782-L788)(`_claimInterest` function), it reverts if the total interest owed is not fundable in full.

```solidity
        UserInfo storage user = users[userAddr];
        uint256 claimable = user.interestEarned;

        require(claimable > 0, "Nothing to claim");

        // Check if we have enough rewards in the contract
        require(rewardsReserve >= claimable, "Insufficient rewards in contract");
```

There is a similar check in `compoundInterest`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The total funding for rewards, rewardsReserve, must be less than the sum total of interest owed to all stakers.

This can occur either if the pool is not fully funded, or if any exploit exists for allowing users to claim extra rewards.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Version 1:

1. Some number of stakers stake and begin accruing interest
2. The rewards pool is funded, but there is some point in time where it is funded less than 100%
3. The stakers either claimInterest() or compoundInterest()
4. The last staker to do so, or last several stakers to do so (depending on size of the shortfall), have their transactions revert with the error message "Insufficient rewards in contract"

Version 2:

1. Some number of stakers stake and begin accruing interest
2. The rewards pool is funded at 100% at all times
3. Someone exploits the issue that allows them to be the most recent staker in the pool yet still at tier 2, thereby claiming too much of the rewards
4. The stakers either claimInterest() or compoundInterest() .
5. The rewards run out before everyone has claimed their interest, even though it was funded at 100%
6. The last staker to claim their interest, or last several stakers to do so (depending on size of the shortfall), have their transactions revert with the error message "Insufficient rewards in contract"

### Impact

If the rewards are only 99.99% funded, then those who supported the project the most may completely lose out on their rewards.

If the rewards are 100% funded, and someone exploits the issue under the title "Under certain circumstances, a staker may remain at tier 2, no matter how many people unstake" (which, BTW, can also happen accidentally; no malicious actor needed), then those who supported the project the most may completely lose out on their rewards.

### PoC

**No POC needed for this issue**

However, I am going to include here the POC for a different issue that makes this one worse, for self-containedness.

### Mitigation

If claimable > rewardsReserve, then allow users to claim rewardsReserve
