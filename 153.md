# Missed Tier Update in `_checkBoundariesAndRecord` When Tier Sizes Remain Constant

### Summary

The `_checkBoundariesAndRecord`['this'](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L841) function, when tier sizes (e.g., `new_t1 == old_t1`) do not change after a user stakes or unstakes, only explicitly checks and updates users at the exact tier boundary ranks (e.g., `old_t1` or `old_t1 + old_t2`). If a user is pushed across a tier boundary by a new staker (or pulled across by an unstaker) but does not land exactly on these checked boundary ranks, their tier might not be updated. This happens because the loops that iterate through ranks are skipped when tier sizes are perceived as unchanged due to integer division in `getTierCountForStakerCount`.


### Root Cause

The `_checkBoundariesAndRecord` function, when tier sizes (e.g., `new_t1 == old_t1`) do not change after a user stakes or unstakes, only explicitly checks and updates users at the exact tier boundary ranks (e.g., `old_t1` or `old_t1 + old_t2`). If a user is pushed across a tier boundary by a new staker (or pulled across by an unstaker) but does not land exactly on these checked boundary ranks, their tier might not be updated. This happens because the loops that iterate through ranks are skipped when tier sizes are perceived as unchanged due to integer division in `getTierCountForStakerCount`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.  A user (User A) is at a rank that is a tier boundary (e.g., rank `R` is the last rank of Tier 1).
2.  Another user (User B) stakes, and their new rank is better than `R` (e.g., `R-k`). User A is pushed from rank `R` to `R+1`.
3.  Due to integer division in `getTierCountForStakerCount` (e.g., `(totalStakers * TIERX_PERCENTAGE) / 100`), the calculated number of slots for Tier 1 (`new_t1`) remains the same as `old_t1` despite the total staker count (`n`) increasing from `old_n`. The same applies to Tier 2 (`new_t2 == old_t2`).
4.  Rank `R+1` (User A's new rank) should now belong to the next lower tier (e.g., Tier 2 if User A was in Tier 1).

### External Pre-conditions

N/A.

### Attack Path

1.  **Initial state**: `TIER1_PERCENTAGE = 20%`. `old_n = 100` stakers. `old_t1 = (100 * 20) / 100 = 20`. User A is at rank 20 (Tier 1).
2.  User B stakes (`!isRemoval`), and `stakerCountInTree` becomes `n = 101`. Assume User B gets a rank `< 20`, pushing existing users down.
3.  **Tier Calculation**: `new_t1 = (101 * 20) / 100 = 20`. Thus, `new_t1 == old_t1`.
4.  **User Movement**: User A is pushed from rank 20 to rank 21.
5.  **`_checkBoundariesAndRecord` Execution (Tier 1 logic)**:
    Since `!isRemoval` and `new_t1 == old_t1`, the code executes `_findAndRecordTierChange(old_t1, n)`, which is `_findAndRecordTierChange(20, 101)`. This correctly updates the tier of the user who is *now* at rank 20.
    User A, who is now at rank 21, is *not* processed by this specific check for Tier 1.
6.  **`_checkBoundariesAndRecord` Execution (Tier 2 logic)**:
    Assume `TIER2_PERCENTAGE = 30%`. `old_t2 = (100 * 30) / 100 = 30`. `new_t2 = (101 * 30) / 100 = 30`. So, `new_t2 == old_t2`.
    The Tier 2 boundary check (when `new_t1 + new_t2 == old_t1 + old_t2`) will execute `_findAndRecordTierChange(old_t1 + old_t2, n)`, i.e., `_findAndRecordTierChange(50, 101)`. This updates the user now at rank 50.
    User A at rank 21 (who should now be Tier 2, as rank 21 is > `new_t1` and <= `new_t1 + new_t2`) is *not* processed by this check either.
7.  **Outcome**: User A's `currentTier` remains Tier 1, despite their rank (21) qualifying them for Tier 2. The system overpays interest to User A.

### Impact

Users who should be demoted to a lower tier due to being pushed down in rank might incorrectly retain their higher tier status. This leads to the protocol overpaying interest to these users, causing a potential loss of funds from the `rewardsReserve` over time. The severity is Medium as it requires specific conditions but has a direct financial impact.
