# Incorrect Tier Assignment Due to Integer Division Edge Cases

## Title  
Incorrect Tier Assignment Due to Integer Division Edge Cases  

## Summary  
When the total number of active stakers (`stakerCountInTree`) is small, the use of integer division to compute tier boundaries (`TIER1_PERCENTAGE` and `TIER2_PERCENTAGE`) can yield zero for counts that users expect to be non-zero. Although the code adds “at least one” for non-zero pools, these heuristics still produce surprising distributions—for example, with 4 stakers the contract ends up assigning 1 Tier 1, 1 Tier 2, and 2 Tier 3 rather than a more even split.

## Root Cause  
The function  
```solidity
tier1Count = (stakerCount * TIER1_PERCENTAGE) / 100;
if (tier1Count == 0 && stakerCount > 0) tier1Count = 1;
tier2Count = (stakerCount * TIER2_PERCENTAGE) / 100;
…
```
uses floor division (`/ 100`). For small `stakerCount`,   
- `(4 * 20) / 100 = 0`, then forced to 1  
- `(4 * 30) / 100 = 1`  

This combination leads to 1 Tier 1 + 1 Tier 2 + (4 – 2) Tier 3 = 2 Tier 3. Users may have expected 1/1/2 or 1/2/1, etc.

## Internal Pre-conditions  
- `stakerCountInTree` is small (e.g. ≤ 5).  
- `getTierCountForStakerCount` is invoked to recalculate tier boundaries after any stake/un-stake or when querying tier counts.

## External Pre-conditions  
- A UI or analytics layer displays tier counts or assigns users to tiers based on `getCurrentTier`.  
- Users join or leave in small numbers such that the rounding effects are not averaged out.

## Attack Path  
This behavior is not a security vulnerability per se and cannot be exploited to steal funds. However, in a low-liquidity scenario an adversary could deliberately manipulate the number of active stakers (by rapidly joining/leaving) to force the system into an edge case, thereby:  
1. Forcing themselves into a higher-reward tier when they “shouldn’t” by making the effective Tier 1 slot count equal to 1.  
2. Causing other honest users to be demoted into lower tiers.

## Impact  
- Users may receive unexpectedly high or low APYs  
- User trust can be eroded by “unfair” tier assignments  
- Analytics and reporting on tier distribution become misleading

## Mitigation  

1. **Change Rounding Strategy**  
   - Switch to nearest-integer rounding for both Tier 1 and Tier 2 counts:  
     ```solidity
     tier1Count = (stakerCount * TIER1_PERCENTAGE + 50) / 100;
     tier2Count = (stakerCount * TIER2_PERCENTAGE + 50) / 100;
     ```  
   - Or always round up:  
     ```solidity
     tier1Count = (stakerCount * TIER1_PERCENTAGE + 99) / 100;
     ```
