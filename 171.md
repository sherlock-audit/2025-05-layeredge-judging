# Stakers can be silently lost beyond maximum capacity in fenwick tree

### Summary

Once `nextJoinId` exceeds the Fenwick tree’s hard cap (`MAX_USERS = 100 000 000`), any new staker receives a `joinId > size` and is never recorded in the tree yet `stakerCountInTree` is still incremented and Staked is emitted. These “ghost” stakers silently corrupt rank math and tier boundaries.

### Root Cause

- [FenwickTree.update](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/library/FenwickTree.sol#L12-L16) only loops `while index <= size`; for `joinId > size`, the loop body is skipped and no tree entry is made 
- The staking logic unconditionally does `stakerCountInTree++` and emits `Staked`, even when the update had no effect 

.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- `nextJoinId` has grown above `MAX_USERS` (100 000 000).
- `_stake` calls `stakerTree.update(joinId, 1)` with `joinId > stakerTree.size`.
- No guard exists to prevent or handle `joinId` overflow past the tree’s capacity.

### External Pre-conditions

- The contract has processed over 100 000 000 unique first-time stakes (or re-stakes that increment `nextJoinId`).
- Additional calls to `stake(...)` continue after crossing that threshold.

### Attack Path

1. Staker #100 000 001 calls `stake`, gets `user.joinId = 100 000 001`.
2. `_stake` invokes `stakerTree.update(100000001, 1)`, but the update loop skips entirely.
3. `_stake` still does `stakerCountInTree++` and emits `Staked`.
4. This repeats for every subsequent staker, creating a growing pool of “ghost” stakers unreflected in the tree.
5. Tier thresholds (`tier1Count = stakerCountInTree × 20%`, etc.) inflate, while the tree’s prefix sums remain based on the true recorded entries—mis-tiering all honest stakers
6. 
### Impact

**Breaks core contract functionality:** Tier distribution and FCFS ordering invariants fail, causing honest users to receive incorrect APY rates.
