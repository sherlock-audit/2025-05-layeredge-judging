# Fenwick tree out-of-bounds user's `joinId` causes incorrect tier calculation and reward misassignment

### Summary

The `LayerEdgeStaking` contract uses a fixed-size Fenwick Tree to track staker positions and compute tiers for APY calculation. The tree is sized for `MAX_USERS`, but the `nextJoinId` used for indexing is unbounded. Over time, `nextJoinId` can exceed `MAX_USERS`, leading to out-of-bounds writes and incorrect rank queries. This compromises the accuracy of tier assignments and the integrity of reward distributions.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L701
`nextJoinId` is incremented without bounds.
However, the Fenwick Tree is fixed at readme:
> 3. MAX_USERS Constraint:
Fenwick tree size fixed at 100,000,000 (MAX_USERS constant)
Cannot be adjusted by admin

No check enforces that `nextJoinId <= MAX_USERS`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

.

### External Pre-conditions

The protocol has had enough staking activity to increment `nextJoinId` past the tree size.
Users stake after `nextJoinId` exceeds `MAX_USERS`.

### Attack Path

Exploit scenario:

Over time, `nextJoinId` reached at `MAX_USERS - 3` and `stakerCountInTree = 0`
After 10 users stake, they have incorrect fee tier.

### Impact

Fee tiers and APYs are miscalculated.
As a result, users are misclassified and earn incorrect APY rewards.
Protocol will lose funds due to large APY rewards.



### PoC

Adds `setNextJoinId` function on `LayerEdgeStaking.sol`.
```solidity
    function setNextJoinId(uint256 _nextJoinId) public {
        nextJoinId = _nextJoinId;
    }
```
The test code is written in `LayerEdgeStakingTest.t.sol`.
```solidity
    function test_Tier_Changed() public {
        uint256 maxUserCnt = 100_000_000;
        address[10] memory stakers = [alice, bob, charlie, david, eve, frank, grace, harry, ian, judy];
        staking.setNextJoinId(maxUserCnt-3);
        setupMultipleStakers(10);

        for (uint256 i; i < 10; ++i) {
            console2.log(stakers[i], uint256(staking.getCurrentTier(stakers[i])));
        }
    }
```
