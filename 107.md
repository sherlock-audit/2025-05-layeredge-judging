## 🔍 Summary

This report covers a full audit of the LayerEdge tiered staking protocol, including its ranking tree and wrapped token mechanism. The system offers FCFS-based APY rewards, using a Fenwick Tree to determine tier positions and enabling both ERC20 and native token staking.

The implementation is modular and well-structured. However, several **critical and medium-risk issues** were identified, mainly related to token interaction and unchecked admin power.
