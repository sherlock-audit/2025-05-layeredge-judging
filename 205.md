# DoS Vulnerability in _checkBoundariesAndRecord Due to Unbounded Loops

### Summary

The _checkBoundariesAndRecord function executes unbounded for loops that iterate over user ranks to adjust tiers. In scenarios where a large number of stakers join or leave the system, this may result in transactions exceeding the block gas limit, making functions that invoke it (e.g., _stake, _unstake) revert. This exposes the contract to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.



### Root Cause

Unbounded for loops in _checkBoundariesAndRecord, which scale linearly with the number of affected ranks (i.e., rank = a to b), without any upper limit or batching mechanism.

### Internal Pre-conditions

stakerCountInTree has a high number of users (tens of thousands or more).

The number of tier transitions within a single operation is large (i.e., big difference between old_t1/new_t1 or old_t2/new_t2).

### External Pre-conditions

A user stakes or unstakes a large enough amount to cause many other users' ranks to change tier.

The attacker can force tier boundary shifts by splitting large stakes across multiple accounts or by alternating deposits/withdrawals.



### Attack Path

1. The attacker creates many accounts with stake amounts around tier boundaries.
2. They stake or unstake from one account, forcing many tier transitions in _checkBoundariesAndRecord.
3. The unbounded loop iterates over a large number of ranks in _findAndRecordTierChange.
4. The transaction exceeds the block gas limit and reverts.
5. This prevents anyone from calling stake() or unstake() if tier recalculation is triggered â€” leading to a DoS.








### Impact

High: Staking and unstaking functionalities can be completely blocked when large tier shifts occur.

Users may lose the ability to manage their assets.

Contract functionality becomes unreliable under load.



### PoC

```solidity
// Simulation: Create multiple stakers and push near-tier thresholds
for (uint i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    stakingContract.stake(amountJustBelowMin, {from: user[i]});
}

// Attacker deposits enough to shift tier boundary significantly
stakingContract.stake(hugeAmount, {from: attacker});

// Results in _checkBoundariesAndRecord processing 1000+ tier shifts
// Causes transaction to run out of gas

```

### Mitigation

Batch Tier Updates: Add a limit parameter to _checkBoundariesAndRecord to restrict how many ranks can be updated per call.

Offload Tier Recalculation: Introduce an external admin-triggered or time-scheduled function to recompute tier boundaries incrementally.

Gas-efficient Data Structures: Consider indexing rank-to-address mappings for faster access or using snapshot-based tiering with delayed resolution.

Fail-safe Mode: Prevent tier updates if the estimated gas exceeds a threshold, and log a deferred update for later manual processing.
