# A malicious staker will prevent new participants from receiving Tier1/2 rewards

### Summary

* A missing boundary check on `nextJoinId` will cause new stakers to be permanently assigned to Tier3 (lowest APY) for future staking, as a malicious staker can exhaust the `nextJoinId` counter beyond `MAX_USERS`.

### Root Cause

* In `LayerEdgeStaking.sol` within the [`_stake`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L700) function (around the lines assigning `user.joinId = nextJoinId++;` and calling `stakerTree.update(...)`), there is no `require(nextJoinId ≤ MAX_USERS)` to enforce the Fenwick tree’s fixed size.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. An attacker must call `stake()` repeatedly from distinct addresses to increment `nextJoinId` up to `MAX_USERS + 1`.
2. The contract must remain unpaused and allow at least `MAX_USERS` staking transactions without hitting other limits.

### External Pre-conditions

*

### Attack Path

1. The attacker orchestrates `MAX_USERS` (100 000 000) successful `stake(amount)` calls from unique wallets, each incrementing `nextJoinId`.
2. On the `(MAX_USERS+1)`ᵗʰ call, `_stake` sets `user.joinId = MAX_USERS + 1` and invokes `stakerTree.update(MAX_USERS+1, 1)`. Since `index > stakerTree.size`, the update silently no-ops.
3. The new staker’s position is never recorded in the Fenwick tree, so any call to `getCurrentTier` computes a rank that places them in Tier3.


### Impact

All future stakers are stuck in Tier3 and earn only the lowest APY, suffering a significant loss compared to Tier1/2 rewards.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
function _stake(uint256 amount, address userAddr, bool isNative) internal {
    require(amount > 0, "Cannot stake zero amount");
+   require(nextJoinId <= MAX_USERS, "Max stakers reached");

}
```
