# System State Inconsistency When `nextJoinId` Exceeds `MAX_USERS` Leads to Minor Skewing of Tier Calculations

### Summary

The `_stake` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L674) assigns `user.joinId = nextJoinId++` without checking if `nextJoinId` exceeds `stakerTree.size` (which is `MAX_USERS`).
-   If `user.joinId` becomes greater than `MAX_USERS`, `stakerTree.update(user.joinId, 1)` will not modify the Fenwick tree data because its internal loop condition (`index <= self.size`) will be false.
-   However, `stakerCountInTree` is still incremented.
-   This creates a discrepancy: `stakerCountInTree` indicates more stakers than are effectively represented in the Fenwick tree's sums.

### Root Cause

Missing boundary check for `nextJoinId` in `_stake` before it's used with `stakerTree.update`. `nextJoinId` can surpass `stakerTree.size`, leading to failed Fenwick tree updates while `stakerCountInTree` is still incremented.

### Internal Pre-conditions

*   `stakerTree.size` is initialized to `MAX_USERS`.
*   `nextJoinId` has reached `MAX_USERS + 1` due to `MAX_USERS` prior eligible stakers.

### External Pre-conditions

*   A new user (the `MAX_USERS + 1`-th) calls `stake()` or `stakeNative()`.
*   Staked `amount >= minStakeAmount`.
*   User is new (`user.isActive` is `false`).
*   Contract is not paused.

### Attack Path

1.  `MAX_USERS` distinct users stake `>= minStakeAmount`, making `nextJoinId = MAX_USERS + 1`.
2.  A `(MAX_USERS + 1)`-th user stakes similarly.
3.  In `_stake` for this user:
    a.  `user.joinId` becomes `MAX_USERS + 1`.
    b.  `stakerTree.update(MAX_USERS + 1, 1)` is called but the Fenwick tree's data remains unchanged as `(MAX_USERS + 1) > self.size`.
    c.  `stakerCountInTree` increments (e.g., to `MAX_USERS + 1`).
    d.  State becomes inconsistent: `stakerCountInTree` reflects `MAX_USERS + 1`, but the Fenwick tree only accounts for `MAX_USERS`.

### Impact

1.  **State Inconsistency**: `stakerCountInTree` over-reports stakers compared to the Fenwick tree's effective count.
2.  **Affected User's Tier**: The user with `joinId > MAX_USERS` will be assigned `Tier.Tier3`. `stakerTree.query(user.joinId)` will return a rank equivalent to `stakerTree.query(MAX_USERS)`, which, when compared against the inflated `stakerCountInTree`, results in `Tier.Tier3`. This is a somewhat graceful handling for the individual.
3.  **Skewed Tier Calculations for Others**: Tier boundaries (calculated using the inflated `stakerCountInTree`) can shift slightly. This might cause some users at the edge of a tier to be incorrectly promoted (e.g., from Tier2 to Tier1).
4.  **Practicality**: `MAX_USERS` (100,000,000) is very high, making this scenario improbable under normal conditions. The logical flaw, however, exists.
