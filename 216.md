# High: Tier Manipulation via Repeated Stake/Unstake Operations

### Summary

The absence of restrictions on frequent stake/unstake operations in LayerEdgeStaking.sol will cause an unfair tier demotion for existing stakers as an attacker will repeatedly stake and unstake to manipulate tier boundaries, disrupting the "First-come-first-serve ordering" and "Tier distribution correctness" invariants.

### Root Cause

In LayerEdgeStaking.sol:592-598 (promotion loop in _checkBoundariesAndRecord) and LayerEdgeStaking.sol:611-617 (demotion loop in _checkBoundariesAndRecord), the recalculation of tier boundaries based on stakerCountInTree is triggered by every stake and unstake operation without restrictions on frequency, allowing an attacker to manipulate the FenwickTree rankings and shift tier boundaries, affecting other users' tiers.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to call setMinStakeAmount to set minStakeAmount to be at least 3000 * 1e18 (as initialized in LayerEdgeStaking.sol:139).
2. Multiple users (at least 5) need to call stake with an amount greater than or equal to minStakeAmount to be included in the FenwickTree and assigned to Tier 1 or Tier 2 (LayerEdgeStaking.sol:351-368).
3. The number of stakers in the FenwickTree (stakerCountInTree) needs to be sufficient to create tier boundaries (e.g., at least 5 stakers to have non-zero Tier 1 and Tier 2 counts, as calculated in LayerEdgeStaking.sol:471-492).

### External Pre-conditions

None required, as the contract does not rely on external protocols for this vulnerability.

### Attack Path

1. An attacker calls stake(amount) (LayerEdgeStaking.sol:175-177) with an amount greater than or equal to minStakeAmount to increase stakerCountInTree and trigger _checkBoundariesAndRecord (LayerEdgeStaking.sol:592-598 for promotion or 611-617 for demotion), which recalculates tier boundaries.
2. The attacker immediately calls unstake(amount) (LayerEdgeStaking.sol:191-193) to decrease stakerCountInTree, again triggering _checkBoundariesAndRecord and shifting users at the tier boundaries (e.g., from Tier 1 to Tier 2 or Tier 2 to Tier 3).
3. The attacker repeats steps 1 and 2 multiple times (e.g., 10 iterations), causing frequent recalculations of tier boundaries, demoting other users to lower tiers or promoting the attacker to a higher tier.

### Impact

The existing stakers suffer an unfair demotion to lower tiers (e.g., from Tier 1 with 50% APY to Tier 2 with 35% APY or Tier 3 with 20% APY, as set in LayerEdgeStaking.sol:132-134). For example, a user staking 10,000 tokens at Tier 1 (50% APY) would earn 5,000 tokens annually, but demotion to Tier 2 (35% APY) reduces earnings to 3,500 tokens, resulting in a loss of 1,500 tokens per year (30% of expected yield). The attacker potentially gains a higher tier (e.g., Tier 1) by manipulating the FenwickTree rankings, increasing their staking rewards. This violates the "First-come-first-serve ordering" (earlier stakers lose priority) and "Tier distribution correctness" (20% Tier 1, 30% Tier 2, 50% Tier 3) invariants specified in the README.md.

### Mitigation

1. Implement a cooldown period (e.g., 1 day) for stake and unstake operations per user by adding a timestamp check in stake (LayerEdgeStaking.sol:175) and unstake (LayerEdgeStaking.sol:191).
2. Use periodic snapshots of stakerCountInTree to determine tier boundaries, reducing the impact of dynamic changes in _checkBoundariesAndRecord (LayerEdgeStaking.sol:592-598 and 611-617).
3. Audit the _checkBoundariesAndRecord function to limit the number of users affected by boundary shifts in a single transaction.
