# Inconsistent Minimum Stake Amount for Different Token Types

### Summary
The `LayerEdgeStaking` contract uses a single `minStakeAmount` for both ERC20 staking tokens and native tokens, leading to potential unfairness and user dissatisfaction, and A potential loss for the user. Due to the price differences between these token types, users staking native tokens may be unfairly placed in a lower tier compared to those staking ERC20 tokens, despite contributing more value.
Because most of the time, the price of the native token is higher than the ERC20 token here.

### Vulnerability Details
- **Root Cause**: `minStakeAmount` is being used for both erc20 token and native token
- **Components Affected**: `stake`, `stakeNative`, `_stake`
- **Impact**: Users staking native tokens may be placed in a lower tier than those staking ERC20 tokens, despite contributing more value, leading to an unfair distribution of rewards and potential user dissatisfaction and a loss for the user.

### Exploit Scenario
1. **Staking with ERC20 Tokens**:
   - User A stakes 3000 ERC20 staking tokens by calling [stake](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L161) function, meeting the `minStakeAmount` requirement and achieving a higher tier.

2. **Staking with Native Tokens**:
   - User B stakes 100 native tokens by calling [stakeNative](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L168) function, which are valued higher than 3000 ERC20 tokens.
   - Due to the single `minStakeAmount`, User B is placed in Tier 3, despite contributing more value.

3. **Unfair Tier Assignment**:
   - User B receives fewer rewards due to being in a lower tier, despite their higher contribution, leading to dissatisfaction and potential loss for him.

### Steps to Exploit
1. **User A Stake with ERC20 Tokens**:
   ```Solidity
   function stake(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
       _stake(amount, msg.sender, false);
   }
   ```

2. **User B Stake with Native Tokens**:
   ```Solidity
   function stakeNative() external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
       _stake(msg.value, msg.sender, true);
   }
   ```

3. **Observe Tier Assignment**:
   - User A is placed in a higher tier with 3000 ERC20 tokens.
   - User B is placed in Tier 3 with 100 native tokens, despite the higher value.

### Recommendations
- **Separate Minimum Stake Amounts**: Implement distinct minimum stake amounts for ERC20 staking tokens and native tokens, such as `minStakeAmountStakeToken` and `minStakeAmountNativeToken`.
- **Logic Adjustment in `_stake`**: Modify the `_stake` function to apply the appropriate minimum stake amount based on the token type being staked.
- **Fair Tier Assignment**: Ensure that tier assignments reflect the actual value contributed by users, regardless of the token type used for staking.
