Title:

`LayerEdgeStaking::withdrawRewards` lacks event emission for admin withdrawals

Severity:

Informational

Description

The LayerEdgeStaking::withdrawRewards function allows the contract owner to withdraw tokens from the staking reward pool. While the function correctly handles the withdrawal logic using the internal rewardsReserve variable, it does not emit any event after a successful withdrawal. In financial smart contracts, emitting events is a common and important practice because it enables off-chain systems, dashboards, and community observers to track key state changes. Without an event, there is no easy way to monitor when and how much was withdrawn by the owner.

Here is the function as implemented:
```solidity
function withdrawRewards(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    require(amount > 0, "Cannot withdraw zero amount");
    require(amount <= rewardsReserve, "Insufficient rewards");

    rewardsReserve -= amount;

    // Transfer tokens to admin
    require(stakingToken.transfer(owner(), amount), "Token transfer failed");
}
```

Impact:

The lack of event emission in this function reduces the transparency of administrative operations. Withdrawals performed by the owner are not reflected in on-chain logs, making it difficult for off-chain tools or community auditors to track how the rewards pool is being managed. This might not pose a direct security risk, but it limits visibility and trust in the protocolâ€™s internal processes. It also makes it harder to debug issues or build automated monitoring systems.

Recommended mitigation

To improve transparency and traceability, the contract should emit an event after every successful withdrawal. A simple event like the following would be sufficient:

```solidity
event RewardsWithdrawn(address indexed recipient, uint256 amount);
```

This can then be added at the end of the withdrawRewards function:

```solidity
emit RewardsWithdrawn(owner(), amount);
```

By emitting this event, the protocol enables better off-chain tracking and provides a clear record of reward pool changes for the community and security reviewers.
