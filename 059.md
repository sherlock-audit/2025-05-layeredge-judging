# Users will lose earned interest when unstaking if tier downgrade skips final interest update

### Summary

When a user's balance falls below minStakeAmount after unstaking, the contract removes them from the Fenwick Tree before recalculating interest. This will cause silent loss of interest for stakers as the tier downgrade skips accurate interest updates.

### Root Cause

In [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#768](https://github.com/zaid261-spec/2025-05-layeredge-zaid261-spec/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L768), the `_unstake()` function reduces the user's balance and removes them from the tier tree if the remaining amount is below `minStakeAmount`. However, it does not recalculate or finalize the user's interest for the period after this unstake action, causing a silent loss of rewards.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User must have a balance just slightly above minStakeAmount.
2. They must unstake enough to fall below the threshold, causing a tier change.

### External Pre-conditions

None — this logic is isolated to internal state updates.

### Attack Path

1. User has 3100 tokens staked.
2. They unstake 200 tokens → new balance is 2900 (below minStakeAmount)
3. Contract removes them from Fenwick Tree and sets outOfTree = true.
4. No interest is accrued for the remaining 2900 tokens held during the final Tier 2 period.

### Impact

The staker suffers silent financial loss due to skipped interest calculation during a tier transition. It weakens trust in accurate reward allocation and causes unfair underpayment.

### PoC

// Track interest before and after unstaking from just above minStakeAmount
// Observe mismatch between expected and actual claimed interest


### Mitigation

Before removing users from the tree or modifying tier status in _unstake(), explicitly trigger _updateInterest(userAddr) after adjusting the balance but before changing outOfTree.
