# Unchecked joinId growth will cause silent staking failures after MAX_USERS overflow

### Summary

The contract assumes that MAX_USERS will never be reached, but does not enforce or cap nextJoinId. This will eventually break tier calculations as stakerTree functions fail for users whose joinId exceeds 100 million.

### Root Cause

In [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#132](https://github.com/zaid261-spec/2025-05-layeredge-zaid261-spec/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L132), the Fenwick Tree is initialized with size = MAX_USERS. In [LayerEdgeStaking.sol#640](https://github.com/zaid261-spec/2025-05-layeredge-zaid261-spec/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L640), nextJoinId increments without checking this boundary. If nextJoinId > MAX_USERS, all tier assignments and queries will fail or misbehave.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. 100 million users have staked, or nextJoinId++ is used aggressively (e.g. testnet spam or airdrop-style botting)

### External Pre-conditions

None — logic is purely internal but has global staking impact

### Attack Path

1. 100M+ stake actions are done (across wallets or test environments)
2. nextJoinId becomes MAX_USERS + 1
3. Any staking attempt throws or corrupts tree-based logic
4. New stakers cannot enter or be ranked correctly

### Impact

Protocol halts or loses accurate tier ranking functionality. All staking-related logic becomes unusable for new users — breaking the APY tier system and reward allocations.

### PoC

// Loop stake from 100M addresses
// Observe failure in stakerTree.update(nextJoinId, 1)


### Mitigation

Add a require(nextJoinId <= MAX_USERS) check before assigning new joinId in _stake(). Alternatively, allow dynamic resizing or reallocation of the tree.
