# Attacker will cause accounting inconsistency through direct ETH transfer manipulation

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/WETH9.sol#L33


## Summary
**The inconsistent accounting between `totalSupply()` and actual token balances will cause incorrect token supply calculations for external protocols as an attacker will send ETH directly to the contract bypassing the deposit mechanism**

## Root Cause
**In `totalSupply()` function line 26, the function returns `address(this).balance` instead of tracking minted tokens, creating a mismatch between reported supply and actual token balances when ETH is sent directly to the contract**

```solidity
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256) {
    return address(this).balance;  // VULNERABLE - can be manipulated
}
```

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. Contract needs to have some legitimate deposits from users
2. Contract address needs to be known to the attacker
3. Users need to have deposited ETH through normal `deposit()` function

## External Pre-conditions
1. Attacker needs to have access to a contract that can `selfdestruct` and send ETH
2. Or attacker needs to set this contract as coinbase recipient in a private blockchain scenario

## Attack Path
1. **Users deposit ETH normally through `deposit()` function, creating legitimate balances**
2. **Attacker deploys a contract with ETH and calls `selfdestruct(address(WETH9_CONTRACT))`**
3. **The ETH is forcibly sent to the WETH9 contract, increasing `address(this).balance`**
4. **`totalSupply()` now returns a value higher than the sum of all user `balanceOf` values**
5. **External protocols using `totalSupply()` for calculations will get incorrect results**

## Impact
**External protocols integrating with this WETH suffer calculation errors and potential fund loss due to inflated total supply. The attacker gains ability to manipulate reported token supply at the cost of the forcibly sent ETH.**
