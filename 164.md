# Users can manipulate their tier because LayerEdgeStaking.sol:;nextJoinId is chronological and made public

### Summary

**Finding Report**: ```Tier Manipulation through Account Spreading```
**Severity**: ```High```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L105

The protocol implements a tier system (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3) that dictates the APY for stakers. The tier assignment is primarily based on the ```joinId```, which is a chronologically increasing identifier assigned to users when they first stake an amount greater than or equal to ```minStakeAmount```. The system prioritizes earlier stakers for higher tiers ("first in, first served" logic).

Specifically, the ```_stake``` function assigns ```user.joinId = nextJoinId++``` for new stakers meeting the minimum stake requirement. The ```_computeTierByRank``` function then determines the user's tier based on their rank within the ```stakerTree```, which is influenced by their ```joinId```.

However, the current implementation allows a malicious or strategic user to manipulate their tier by creating **multiple accounts** and strategically staking minimum amounts. A user who is initially placed in a lower tier (e.g., Tier 3) due to their ```joinId``` **(later entry)** can create a new account, stake the ```minStakeAmount``` from this new account, and effectively "push" their original account into a higher tier by shifting the ```stakerCountInTree``` and thus their relative rank. By this user will be earning more which he won't be able to do just by depositing more through the same account.

### Root Cause

Making ```uint256 public nextJoinId``` public is the root cause. Now anyone can calculate the total users in the staker tree and manipulate it.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The attack doesn't require any pre-conditions. Users just need to calculate how many accounts with ```minStakeAmount``` it would take to improve their tier to a higher tier and they can create. The strategy don't make them loose funds, they still get the interest of the last tier, but they effectively increase the position of their primary account in the tier system to earn more apy which wouldn't be possible if they deposited the same amount from their primary account.

### External Pre-conditions

This attack doesn't require any pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. A user initially deposits a big amount from his primary account and ```stake``` and get an earlier joinId.
2. Then user creates some secondary accounts to bring change in the tier division and gradually increase the position of primary account.
3. If by depositing a very big amount still gives tier 3 to user, the user will create multiple accounts and will deposit most of the amount with the primary account to get the earlier joinId and with secondary accounts, deposit only ```minStakeAmount``` to gradually increase his primary accounts position from tier 3 to tier 2 which wouldn't be possible if he only deposited all the tokens with the same account and he would be getting the tier 3 apy. 

### Impact

The attack can lead to several ```Critical``` invariant losses:-

1. **Unfair Tier Distribution**: The core principle of _"first in, first served"_ is undermined. Users can artificially improve their tier and associated APY without necessarily loosing funds or even staking very late.
2. **Economic Manipulation**: This vulnerability allows users to gain a higher APY than intended, potentially leading to increased protocol expenditure on rewards and reduced profitability or sustainability.
3. **User Dissatisfaction**: Legitimate stakers who cannot or choose not to engage in this multi-account manipulation will be disadvantaged, leading to frustration and potential loss of trust in the protocol.
4. **Increased Complexity/Gas Costs**: While the PoC involves creating new accounts, in a real-world scenario, a sophisticated attacker could automate this process, potentially increasing network congestion and gas costs for all users.
5. **Invariant brake**: The vulnerability breaks the core invariant of the protocol (FCFS) where even late comers can manipulate the protocol and realise high APY from high tiers.

Test Explained:-

1. **Initial State**: 
           i) Bob (joinId 1) and Charlie (joinId 2) stake MIN_STAKE and are initially assigned to Tier 1 and Tier 2 respectively.
           ii) Alice (joinId 3) stakes LARGE_STAKE and, due to her joinId and the distribution of tiers, is 
               placed in Tier 3.
           iii) Harry, Eve, and Frank also stake MIN_STAKE and are placed in Tier 3.
           iv) The getTierCounts() confirms 1 Tier 1, 1 Tier 2, and 4 Tier 3 stakers.
           v)  Alice's initial tier is correctly identified as Tier 3 with an APY of 20%.
2. **Exploit Steps**:
           i) Alice, currently in Tier 3 with her primary account, creates a new account (alice2).
           ii) Alice, using alice2, stakes MIN_STAKE. This new account receives a new joinId (e.g., 7).
           iii) Although alice2 will be in a lower tier, the act of alice2 joining the stakerTree causes a re-calculation of tiers for all existing members. 
                Because the stakerCountInTree increases, the thresholds for the tiers shift.
3. **Outcome**:
           i) After alice2 stakes, the stakerCountInTree increases.
           ii) When Alice's (original account) tier is re-evaluated using _computeTierByRank, her rank relative to the increased stakerCountInTree now 
              falls within the boundaries of Tier 2.
           iii) The getTierCounts() now shows 1 Tier 1, 2 Tier 2, and 4 Tier 3 stakers.
           iv) Alice's original account (alice) is successfully promoted from Tier 3 to Tier 2, and her APY increases from 20% to 35%.


### Mitigation

The current tiering mechanism based solely on chronological ```joinId``` within a dynamic ```stakerCountInTree``` is susceptible to manipulation.To prevent this, consider redesigning the tiering logic. The most effective and straightforward solution is to re-evaluate the primary criteria for tier assignment, shifting the focus from chronological ```joinId``` and to the actual balance (amount staked) by a user or some other approach.
