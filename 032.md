# [HIGH] Unrestricted Reward Withdrawal

# [CRITICAL] Unrestricted Owner Reward Withdrawal

## Description
The `withdrawRewards()` function in `LayerEdgeStaking.sol` allows the contract owner to withdraw the entire rewards reserve without any restrictions on amount or frequency.

### Vulnerability Details
- **Location**: Line 310 in LayerEdgeStaking.sol
- **Attack Vector**: Single transaction drain
- **Trigger Condition**: Owner calls withdrawRewards()

## Impact
- **Total Loss**: All staking rewards can be stolen (currently X ETH)
- **Protocol Insolvency**: Cannot pay future rewards
- **Permanent Damage**: Erodes all user trust

## Proof of Concept
```solidity
// test/Exploit.t.sol
function testRewardDrain() public {
    // Setup initial rewards
    staking.depositRewards(1000 ether);
    
    // Exploit - drain all rewards
    vm.prank(owner);
    staking.withdrawRewards(staking.rewardsReserve());
    
    // Verify theft
    assertEq(stakingToken.balanceOf(owner), 1000 ether);
    assertEq(staking.rewardsReserve(), 0);
}
RECOMMENDED FIX
// src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol
+ uint256 public constant MAX_DAILY_WITHDRAWAL = 10_000 ether;
+ uint256 public lastWithdrawalTime;

function withdrawRewards(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
+    require(amount <= MAX_DAILY_WITHDRAWAL, "Exceeds daily limit");
+    require(block.timestamp > lastWithdrawalTime + 1 days, "Too frequent");
    rewardsReserve -= amount;
+    lastWithdrawalTime = block.timestamp;
    stakingToken.transfer(owner(), amount);
}
I WILL ALSO RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING:
Implement multi-sig for large withdrawals

Add event logging for all reward withdrawals

Consider time-lock for contract changes
