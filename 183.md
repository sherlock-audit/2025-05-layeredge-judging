# Permanent demotion” is triggered by a first-stake below minStakeAmount, not by an unstake – breaks tier invariant and counter bookkeeping

### Summary

The README’s invariant says: “Permanent tier demotion: Users who unstake below minStakeAmount should permanently remain in Tier 3.”
However, the implementation demotes a user permanently when their very first stake is below minStakeAmount, even if they never unstake.
This violates the stated rule, lets large later deposits stay in Tier 3, and leaves the user out of the Fenwick tree, so global tier counters are wrong for the lifetime of the contract.

### Root Cause

In LayerEdgeStaking.sol _stake() 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L692

```solidity

// First deposit below minimum
if (!user.isActive && amount < minStakeAmount) {
    stakerCountOutOfTree++;
    user.isActive = true;
    user.outOfTree = true;        // permanent flag
    _recordTierChange(userAddr, tier);     // Tier3
}

```
No path later clears outOfTree or inserts the user into stakerTree
once their balance exceeds minStakeAmount.

### Internal Pre-conditions

minStakeAmount is set (default 3 000 ).
A new user calls stake(x) where x < minStakeAmount.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Eve stakes 2 000  (below minimum). → She is flagged outOfTree = true, never inserted, counted in stakerCountOutOfTree.
Eve immediately stakes 100 000  more. → Branch is skipped (user.isActive == true), still out-of-tree.
stakerCountInTree remains unchanged; percentage thresholds computed from this smaller number are wrong forever.
Eve can never reach Tier 1/2, contradicting the invariant that only an unstake below minimum should lock her out.

### Impact

• Fairness: early stakers who accidentally deposited too little lose any
chance of Tier 1/2 rewards even after topping-up.
• Accounting: all tier-count maths (20 / 30 / 50 %) operate on an
understated population, so promotions/demotions are mis-assigned; some
users get higher APY than they should, others lower.
• This error persists for the life of the contract.

### PoC

```solidity


function test_firstStakeBelowMin_thenTopUp() public {
    // step 1: stake below minimum
    vm.prank(alice);
    staking.stake(MIN_STAKE - 1 ether);

    // step 2: large top-up
    vm.prank(alice);
    staking.stake(MIN_STAKE * 10);

    // Alice still Tier3
    assertEq(
        uint256(staking.getCurrentTier(alice)),
        uint256(LayerEdgeStaking.Tier.Tier3),
        "Should have been promoted after top-up"
    );

    // Tree believes zero stakers
    (uint256 t1,uint256 t2,uint256 t3) = staking.getTierCounts();
    assertEq(t1 + t2 + t3, 0, "Counters out of sync");
}

```

### Mitigation

Allow re-insertion when a user who is outOfTree crosses the threshold for the first time:

```solidity
if (user.outOfTree && user.balance >= minStakeAmount && !user.wasDemoted) {
    user.outOfTree = false;
    // add to tree, update counts, record tier change
}
```
wasDemoted would be set only in the real “unstake-below-minimum”
branch so the invariant in the README still holds.

Alternatively forbid the very first stake to be below
minStakeAmount:

```solidity

require(user.isActive || amount >= minStakeAmount,
        "Initial deposit must meet minimum");

```
Either change aligns the implementation with the specification and
keeps tier counters accurate.
