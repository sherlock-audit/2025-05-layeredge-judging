# Potential Reentrancy Risk on ETH Transfers via Low-Level call

The contract sends ETH using a low-level call without a reentrancy guard, which can be risky.

See the relevant lines here: 

[LayerEdgeStaking.sol line 563](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/main/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol?plain=1#L563)

```solidity
(bool success,) = payable(userAddr).call{value: request.amount}("");
require(success, "Native token transfer failed");
```

and:

LayerEdgeStaking.sol line 628

```solidity
(bool success,) = payable(userAddr).call{value: claimable}("");
require(success, "Native token transfer failed");
```

Using call like this without reentrancy protection may open the contract to reentrancy attacks, especially if state changes happen after the external call.

Recommendation:

Implement a reentrancy guard (e.g., OpenZeppelinâ€™s ReentrancyGuard) or follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to ensure state changes occur before external calls.
