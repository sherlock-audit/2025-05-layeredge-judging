# Tier Position Not Updated After Balance Increases

### Summary

Missing tier position updates in both `compoundInterest()` and `_stake()` functions will cause financial losses for stakers as users with increased balances will remain in lower tiers despite qualifying for higher APY rates.

### Root Cause

There are two related root causes:

- In [LayerEdgeStaking.sol:196-224](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/029b25ca38242ac844f5289547dc759ad2eb308b/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L202-L230) the `compoundInterest()` function updates the user's balance but fails to update their position in the Fenwick tree or trigger tier boundary recalculations.

- In [LayerEdgeStaking.sol:672-722](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-layeredge/blob/029b25ca38242ac844f5289547dc759ad2eb308b/edgen-staking/src/stake/LayerEdgeStaking.sol#L678-L728) the `_stake()` function doesn't handle the scenario where a user initially staked below `minStakeAmount` (marked as `outOfTree`) and later increases their stake above the minimum threshold.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user has an active stake in the contract and falls into one of these categories:
   - User has staked tokens and is earning interest
   - User initially staked below `minStakeAmount` and is marked as `outOfTree`

2. The tier distribution and APY rates must be configured so that higher tiers provide higher APY rates (e.g., Tier1APY > Tier2APY > Tier3APY)

### External Pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions are required for this vulnerability.

### Attack Path

For the compounding scenario:
1. User stakes an amount that places them in a lower tier (e.g., Tier 3)
2. User accumulates interest over time
3. User calls `compoundInterest()` which increases their balance enough to qualify for a higher tier
4. User's balance increases but their tier position remains unchanged in the Fenwick tree
5. User continues to receive the lower tier APY rate despite having a balance that should qualify for a higher tier
6. The financial loss continues to accumulate as long as the user remains in the lower tier

For the out-of-tree scenario:
1. User initially stakes below `minStakeAmount` and is marked as `outOfTree` (automatically in Tier 3)
2. User later calls `stake()` to add more tokens, bringing their total balance above `minStakeAmount`
3. Despite having sufficient balance, the user remains `outOfTree` and in Tier 3
4. User continues to receive the lowest APY rate indefinitely, even if their balance would qualify for Tier 1 or Tier 2


### Impact

The impact is financial loss for affected users. If tier1APY = 50%, tier2APY = 35%, and tier3APY = 20%:
- Users who should be in Tier 1 but remain in Tier 3 lose 30% APY on their entire stake
- Users who should be in Tier 2 but remain in Tier 3 lose 15% APY on their entire stake

For a user with 1000 tokens who should be in Tier 1 but remains in Tier 3, this represents a loss of 300 tokens per year in potential rewards.

The protocol also suffers from undermined trust as the invariant of "tier distribution must be strictly maintained" is violated.

### PoC

The following test case demonstrates how a user can increase their balance above the minimum stake threshold through compounding, but their tier doesn't get updated, keeping them in a lower tier:

```solidity
function test_LayerEdgeStaking_TierUpgradeOnCompound() public {
    // Alice stakes just below the minimum
    uint256 smallStake = MIN_STAKE - 1;
    vm.startPrank(alice);
    token.approve(address(staking), smallStake);
    staking.stake(smallStake);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Alice should be out-of-tree (Tier 3)
    assertEq(uint256(staking.getCurrentTier(alice)), uint256(LayerEdgeStaking.Tier.Tier3), "Should be Tier 3 (out-of-tree)");

    // Advance time to accrue interest
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 30 days);
    
    // Fund rewards if needed
    vm.startPrank(admin);
    if (token.allowance(admin, address(staking)) < 1e18) {
        token.approve(address(staking), 100_000 * 1e18);
    }
    if (token.balanceOf(address(staking)) < 1e18) {
        staking.depositRewards(100_000 * 1e18);
    }
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Alice compounds her interest
    vm.startPrank(alice);
    staking.compoundInterest();
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Alice's balance should now be above or equal to MIN_STAKE
    (uint256 balance,,,,,,,,,) = staking.users(alice);
    assertGe(balance, MIN_STAKE, "Balance should be >= MIN_STAKE after compounding");

    // Check if tier was upgraded - this FAILS because tier remains Tier 3 when it should be Tier 1
    LayerEdgeStaking.Tier tier = staking.getCurrentTier(alice);
    emit log_named_uint("Alice's tier after compounding", uint256(tier));
    // This assertion fails, proving the bug:
    assertEq(uint256(tier), uint256(LayerEdgeStaking.Tier.Tier1), "Tier should be upgraded to Tier 1 after compounding");
}
```

**Test Output:**
```Solidity
[FAIL: Tier should be upgraded to Tier 1 after compounding: 3 != 1] test_LayerEdgeStaking_TierUpgradeOnCompound() (gas: 439398)
```

### Mitigation

Add proper tier position updates to both `compoundInterest()` and `_stake()` functions
